THE PIXIE IN 

THE 

POND 





ONCE upon a time there was a small pixie called Whistle. You can 
guess why he had that name he was always whistling merrily ! He 
lived with his mother and father in a little toadstool house not far from 
a big pond. It was a lonely house, for no other pixies lived near, and as 
white ducks swam on the pond there were no frogs or toads for Whistle 
to play with. 

" I'm very lonely, Mother," Whistle said, a dozen times a day. " I 
wish I could play with the field-mice. They want to show me their tunnels 
under the roots of the oak tree." 

" No, Whistle," said his mother firmly. " The last time you went 
to see a mouse's nest you got lost underground, and I had to pay three 
moles to go and look for you. You are not to play with field-mice." 

" Well, can I play with the hedgehog then? " asked Whistle. " He is 
a good fellow for running about with me in the fields." 

" Certainly not! " said his mother. " His prickles would tear your 
nice clothes to pieces. Now run out and play by yourself, Whistle, and 
don't worry me any more." 

So Whistle went out by himself, looking very gloomy. It was dull 
having to play by himself, very dull. He shook his head when Tiny the 
field-mouse ran up to him and squeaked to him to come and play. He 
didn't go near the hedgehog when he saw him in the ditch. Whistle was 
an obedient little pixie. 

He ran oflF to the pond. He liked to watch the big dragon-flies there. 
They were nearly as big as he was. 

It was whilst he was watching the dragon-flies that he saw a merry 
little head poking out of the water nearby, watching the dragon-flies too ! 



THE PIXIE IN THE POND 

Whistle stared in surprise. He didn't know there was anybody else near, 
and here was a little pixie in the pond a pixie about as small as himself, 
too! 

" Hallo! " said Whistle. " Who are you? " 

" I'm Splash, the water-pixie," said the little fellow, climbing out of 
the water and sitting beside Whistle. " I live in the pond with my father 
and mother. We only came last week. I didn't think there was any one for 
me to play with, and now I've found you. What luck! ' 

" Oh, Splash, I'm so pleased! " said Whistle. " My name is Whistle. 
We can play together every day. What shall we play at? ' : 

" Come into the water and I'll teach you to swim," said Splash. 

" But what about my clothes? " said Whistle. " They'll get wet." 

" Well, they'll dry, won't they? " said Splash. "Come along! Mind 
that mud! " 

But dear me, Whistle was so anxious to get into the water that he 
floundered right into the mud, and you should have seen how he looked ! 
He was black from head to foot! 

" Oh dear! " said Whistle, in dismay. " Look at that! I'd better get 
out and dry myself, and then see if the mud will brush off. Come and sit 
by me, Splash, and I'll teach you to whistle." 

So Splash sat by Whistle in the sun, and the pixie taught his friend to 
whistle loudly. By the time the dinner-hour came, Splash could whistle 
like a blackbird ! Whistle's clothes were dry, but the mud wouldn't brush 
off. It stuck to his clothes, and was all over his face and hands too. The 
two pixies said good-bye, and each ran off to his dinner. 

Oh dear ! How cross Whistle's mother was when she saw his clothes ! 
' You bad, naughty pixie ! " she scolded. " You have been in the pond. 
Take off your clothes at once. You must have a hot bath." 

" Oh, Mother, don't be angry with me," begged Whistle. " I have 
found a friend to play with. It is a water-pixie called Splash ! " 

" Indeed! " said his mother, pouring hot water into the tin bath. 
* Well, just remember this, Whistle you are not to play with water- 
pixies at all! You will only get muddy and wet, and I won't have it! " 

" But, Mother! " cried Whistle, in dismay, " I do so like Splash! He 
is so nice. He wanted to teach me to swim." 

' You'll drown before you learn to swim in that weedy pond," said 

8 



THE PIXIE IN THE POND 

his mother. " Now remember, Whistle, I forbid you to play with that 
water-pixie." 

Whistle said no more. He knew it was no use, but he was very sad. 
It was hard to find a friend, and then not to be allowed to keep him, 

That afternoon, Whistle stole down to the pond. Splash was there, 
sitting in a swing he had made of bent reed. He was whistling away, 
having a lovely time, eagerly waiting for Whistle. 

" What's the matter? " he cried, when he saw the pixie's gloomy 
face. 

" Mother was very cross about my muddy suit^-and says I mustn't 
play with you," said Whistle sadly. " So I came to tell you. After this 
I shan't come down to the pond, because if I do I might see you and play 
with you, and I don't want to upset my mother." 

" Oh, bother ! " said Splash, in dismay. " Just as we have found one 
another so nicely. It's too bad! ' 

" Good-bye, Splash," said Whistle. " I'm very, very sorry, but I 
must go." 




What's the matter ? " he cried, when he saw the pixie's gloomy face. 



THE PIXIE IN THE POND 

Off he ran home; and just as he got there he met his father, who called 
to him. 

" Whistle! How would you like to go for a sail on the pond this 
afternoon? I've got a fine little boat here that used to belong to a 
child." 

" Ooh, how lovely! " said Whistle, looking at the toy boat, which 
was leaning up against the side of the toadstool house and was even bigger 
than the house itself! 

" Mother ! Where are you? " called Whistle, in excitement. " Are 
you coming for a sail too? ' 

" Yes ! " said his mother. So in a short time the little family set off to 
the pond, Whistle and his father carrying the ship, and his mother running 
behind. They set the boat on the water, and then they all got in. 

It was a windy day. The wind filled the little white sail and the ship 
blew into the middle of the pond. What fun it was ! Whistle's father 
guided the boat along and Whistle leaned over to look for fish. He saw 
a big one, and leaned so far over that he lost his balance! Splash! Into 
the water he went head-first! 

" Oh! Oh! Save him! He can't swim!" cried Whistle's mother in 
dismay. " Oh, Whistle, Whistle! Quick, turn the boat about and save 
Whistle! " 

But just then the wind blew so hard that the ship simply tore across 
the pond and left Whistle struggling in the water. Poor little pixie he 
couldn't swim, and he was in great trouble. 

But suddenly up swam Splash, the water-pixie. He had watched the 
boat setting sail, and had kept by it all the way, though the others hadn't 
seen him. As soon as he saw his friend fall into the water he swam up to 
him, and catching hold of him under the arms, he swam with him to the 
boat. 

" Oh, you brave little fellow! " said Whistle's father, as he pulled 
the two of them into the boat. " You have saved Whistle ! He might 
have drowned! Who are you? ' : 

" I am Splash, the water-pixie," said Splash. " I live in the pond. I 
would very much like to be friends with Whistle and teach him to swim. 
He has taught me to whistle like a blackbird, and my mother is very 
pleased. I should like to do something for him in return." 

10 



THE PIXIE IN THE POND 




" Oh, you brave little fellow 1 " said Whistle's father. 

" Oh, you are the bravest little pixie I have ever seen! " cried Whistle's 
mother, as she sat hugging Whistle to her. " Please be friends with 
Whistle. He must certainly learn to swim. I will make him a little bathing 
suit, and then it won't matter if he gets wet or muddy." 

"Oh, Mother, how lovely! " cried Whistle, in delight. "I told 
Splash this afternoon that I could never see him again, and I said good-bye 
to him, because you said I wasn't to play with him and now he is to be 
my friend after all! ' 

" You deserve it, for you're a good, obedient little pixie," said his 
father. " Now you'd better bring your friend home to tea with you, if 
Mother has enough cake! ' 

" Oh yes, I made treacle buns this morning," said Whistle's mother, 
" and there is some new blackberry jam too. Ask your mother if you can 
come, Splash! ' 

Splash jumped into the water and swam to his cosy little home in the 
reeds. In a moment or two, three pixies popped their heads out of the 
water for Splash had brought his father and mother. 

" Thank you for the invitation," said Splash's pretty little pixie- 
mother. " He will be most delighted to come. I am just going to brush 
his hair. Perhaps you will all come to tea with us to-morrow? We should 
love to have you." 

So all the pixies became friends, and now Splash and Whistle play 
together all day long, and Whistle can swim just as well as Splash can; 
and as for Splash's whistling, well you should just hear it! The two 
pixies sound like a cage full of canaries !

She Wouldn't Believe It 

THERE was once a very old, very proud doll. Her name was Florrie, 
and she belonged to Katie. She was proud because she had belonged 
to Katie's mother when she was a little girl so you can guess that Florrie 
was very old indeed. 

Now the other toys in the nursery wanted to be friends with Florrie 
but Florrie thought herself far too grown-up and grand to bother with 
young toys like the smiling sailor-doll, the blue teddy-bear, the golden- 
haired doll, and the pretty Snow- White with her black hair. 

" If you speak to me you must call me Madam," she told the toys. 
" And pray don't disturb me at night with your chatter and play. Be as 
quiet as you can." 

The toys giggled. They thought Florrie was very funny. She had a 
big china head with brown hair, rather tangled. Her dress, which was of 
blue silk spotted with yellow, came to her feet, and she wore brown kid 
shoes with laces. A pink sash was tied round her waist. 

" She's so old-fashioned ! ' whispered the toys to one another. " She 
won't play or laugh she just goes for lonely walks round the nursery by 
herself. I wonder what she's made of rubber, do you think? " 

Nobody knew. The golden-haired doll was made of rubber and could 
be bathed. Snow- White had a pink velvet body, very soft and cuddle- 
some. They couldn't think what Florrie was made of. 

Well, she was stuffed with sawdust, just as all old dolls were! But she 
didn't tell anyone this, for she felt a little ashamed of it. She went each

night for her long walks round the 
nursery, and turned up her china 
nose at any toy she met. 

And then one night the teddy- 
bear saw a curious thing. He 
noticed that wherever Florrie went 
she left a thin trail of something 
behind her. Whatever could it be? 

He went to look at it. It 
seemed like thick yellow dust to 
him. He did not know what sawdust was, for he had never seen any. 
Could it be some powder that Florrie used? 

He called the other toys and told them about it. They watched 
Florrie, and saw that it was quite true. She did leave a little trail of dust 
behind her wherever she went! 

Florrie didn't notice it, of course. You can't see much when your 
nose is in the air. But soon the toys began to notice something else too. 

"Florrie's getting thinner!" whispered the teddy-bear to Snow- 
White. " Isn't it strange? " 

Snow-White looked at Florrie. " So she is! " said the doll. " I 
wonder why." 

" I think I know! " said the sailor-doll. " That dust we keep finding 
here and there is what she's stuffed with. She's leaking! She'll soon be 
gone to nothing!" 

"How dreadful!" said the golden-haired doll. "I'm made of 
rubber, so I can't leak. What will happen to Florrie? * 

" She'll just leak till she's 
empty and then she won't have a 



But Snow-White was kind- 
hearted. " We must warn Flor-

to the big old doll and spoke to 
her timidly. " Please, Madam,"

Please, Madam, I've something to say."

SHE WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT 

" Then say it quickly," said Florrie, in her grandest voice. 

" We think you're leaking," said Snow- White. " Don't you think 
you'd better not walk about any more ? You might leak away to nothing." 

Florrie was very angry. " Leaking ! " she cried. " I don't believe it ! 
It's just a horrid trick of yours to stop me taking my evening walks. 
Don't let me hear another word ! ' 

Well, Snow-White couldn't do anything. She and the other toys 
watched Florrie walking about, leaving her trail of sawdust everywhere 
as usual, and they wondered how soon all her sawdust would be gone. 

Now the little hole that had come in Florrie's back suddenly got very 
much bigger and one evening such a heap of sawdust trickled out that 
really there was hardly any of poor Florrie left except her head and her 
clothes and the pink covering that used to hold in the sawdust. So she 
crumpled up on the carpet, and lay there all alone ! The toys were upset, 
but before they could do anything the door opened and in walked Katie's 
mother ! 

Of course she saw Florrie on the floor and she picked her up. She saw 
the sawdust, and she knew what had happened. 

" Oh, poor Florrie! " she said. " You're leaking! I'll have to get you 
a nice new body. Sawdust is out of fashion now ! ' 

So she took Florrie away, and the toys didn't see her for two weeks. 
When she came back she was quite different ! The toy-man had given her 
a nice fat velvet body, with baby legs and feet. Her long dress didn't fit 
her any more, so Mother had made her a woollen frock and a bonnet. She 
looked sweet! 

The toys quickly cooked a few buns on the little stove, and held a 
party to welcome Florrie back. She was so pleased. The toys in the toy- 
shop had laughed at her for being old-fashioned, and had called her 
:< Madam Sawdust." It was lovely to be back in the nursery, where the 
toys made a fuss of her. 

" I'm so glad to see you all," said Florrie. " I'm sorry I was silly and 
stuck-up before. I'm half new and half old now, so I feel quite different. 
I'd like to join in your games and be friends." 

' You shall, Florrie! " cried every one; and you should just see them 
each night, having a lovely time with Florrie. Everybody is pleased that 
Florrie is so different except one person. 



SHE WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT 




They held a party to welcome Florrie back. 

Katie's mother is quite sad when she sees Florrie. " I wish you were 
the old Florrie! " she says. " I don't seem to know you nowJ I loved 
you best when you were filled with sawdust ! ' 

But Katie likes Florrie better now that she is more cuddlesome, so 
Florrie is really very happy!

ONCE upon a time there was a lovely nursery where all kinds of toys 
lived happily together. The golliwog lived in the toy-cupboard with 
the soldiers, the bricks, the balls and the games. The fairy doll, who was 
very pretty indeed, lived in the dolls' house, and thought herself very grand. 

Then there were other dolls, who lived on the big window-seat with 
the animals. Not one of the dolls was so pretty as the fairy doll, but one 
of them was very clever. 

This was a small doll dressed as a nurse. She really did know a lot of 
things. She could nurse people very well, and if any of the toys hurt 
themselves, or got broken, or were ill, she always knew exactly what to do. 

The golliwog loved the fairy doll. He thought she was the prettiest 
doll he had ever seen, and he did wish she would let him live in the dolls' 
house with her, because there was plenty of room. But she wouldn't. 

" I'll go for walks with you, and I'll go out to tea with you, and I'll 
share your sweets but I don't want anyone living in my house! " said 
the fairy doll. 

So the golliwog had to be content with giving the fairy doll nearly all 
his sweets, and with taking her out to tea in the little toy tea-shop whenever 
he could. 

One day the nurse doll began to speak to all the toys around in her 
gentle voice. 

" Toys," she said, " I think it would be a good thing if I taught you 



THE GOLLIWOG WHO LISTENED 

all some of the things I know. Some day I shall be an old toy, and perhaps 
the children will give me away. Then you will not have me to nurse you 
and mend you. But if I tell you all I know, and you learn it well, you will 
be able to look after each other." 

The toys thought this was a very good idea. " We'll all come and 
listen to you each night! " they said; but the fairy doll sulked. 

" Who wants to listen to the dull things that that silly old nurse doll 
tells? " she said to the golliwog. " Don't listen to her, Golly. Come for 
a walk with me instead. Let's go and visit the rocking-horse and ask him 
for a ride." 

" I will, after I've heard what the nurse doll has to say to-night," said 
Golly. 

That made the fairy doll very angry indeed. She always liked to have 
her own way, and she walked off in a rage, her pretty little nose stuck up 
in the air, and her pretty little feet stamping loudly ! 

The golliwog sighed but he went to join the ring that sat round the 
clever little nurse doll. 

That night she told them what to do with cuts and scratches, and she 
showed them her little bottle of brown iodine. " Always wash a cut or a 
scratch," she said, " and then dab it with the stufTout of this bottle. Then 
your cuts will never go bad, but will heal up quickly. Don't forget, will 
you? " 

The toys promised not to. They ran ofF to play. 

The golliwog went to find the fairy doll, but the naughty little thing 
had locked herself in the dolls' house, and she wouldn't come out. The 
golliwog was sad. But all the same he went to listen to the nurse doll's 
lesson the next night too, although the fairy doll said she would never go 
out to tea with him again if he did. 

" But, fairy doll, it's important that we should know how to look 
after ourselves and after each other too," he said. " Don't you think you 
ought to come? You might learn something that would be very useful 
to you one day." 

" Pooh!" said the fairy doll rudely, and she actually threw a brick 
at the golliwog. It didn't hit him but he felt very hurt, all the same. 

That night the nurse doll explained how to treat a cold. " It is best 
to go to bed at once," she said, " and to keep very warm and have 

18 




THE GOLLIWOG WHO LISTENED 

a hot drink. Then the cold will go 
away quickly; but if you are silly and 
won't go to bed, you will be very ill. 
Now will you all remember that?" 
The toys said they would, and 
the nurse doll made them tell her 
what she had told them the night 
before. 

"Good! " she said. "You 
are learning your lessons well! 
Come again to-morrow. I have 
something very important to teach 
you." 

So they all went again the next 
night, and she told them about sun- 
stroke. " You must always wear a 
hat that shades the back of your 
neck when you go out into the hot 
sun," she said. "If you don't, you 
will get sunstroke, and be ill. This is a very important thing to remember. 
I saw you, wooden soldier, going about in the blazing sun last summer 
without even your helmet on. Don't do it again." 

" What should we have to do with the soldier if he did get sunstroke?" 
asked the golliwog, who liked to know everything he could. 

" We should have to put him straight to bed in as dark a room as pos- 
sible," said the nurse doll. " That's all for to-night, my dears. Come again 
to-morrow." 

The next night the toys went again, and this time the nurse doll told 
them what to do if anyone got on fire. 

" You know," she said, " sometimes people play with matches, or go 
too near the fire, and their clothes catch alight. Now listen carefully and I 
will tell you what to do. If you see anyone alight, you must quickly get a 
rug or a thick blanket and wrap it so tightly round them that the flames 
can't burn any more and so they go out. That is the best thing to do. Then 
put them to bed, keep them very warm, give them some hot milk, and call 
the doctor. Now can you remember all that? " 

19 



She actually threw a brick at him. 



THE GOLLIWOG WHO LISTENED 




"I saw you, Wooden Soldier, going about in the bla2ing sun." 



Some of the toys couldn't, so the nurse doll said it all over again. The 
golliwog had a good memory and he soon knew it all. He went to find the 
fairy doll, after the lesson was over, for he thought that really she would be 
interested to hear what the nurse doll had taught them that night. 

But the fairy doll was still sulking, though she was really getting a bit 
tired of being so silly. 

" Go away ! " she said. " I'm tired of seeing you go to the nurse doll's 
silly lessons every night when you might be playing with me. You are 
very horrid." 

** But, fairy doll, the lessons may be so useful," said the golliwog. 
' Think now I know what to do if anyone cuts or scratches himself; I 
know what to do for sunstroke; I know what to do for a cold; and I even 
know what to do if anyone gets on fire ! ' 

" Pooh! " said the fairy doll, banging her front-door shut. " Who 
wants to know dull things like that! ' 

The golliwog went away and played sadly with the clockwork mouse, 
who pretended that he had a cold and wanted the golly to nurse him. The 

20 



THE GOLLIWOG WHO LISTENED 

golliwog loved the fairy doll very much, but he couldn't help thinking she 
was behaving in a horrid, unkind manner. 

The next night was terribly cold so cold that the nurse doll said 
there wouldn't be any lesson. 

" You had better all cuddle up to one another and keep each other 
warm," she said. " Jack Frost is about to-night, ready to pinch our fingers 
and toes ! ' 

The golliwog went to the dolls' house to ask if the fairy doll would 
come out and sit on the shelf with him, so that he could warm her. But 
she wouldn't open the door. 

" I'm going to light my fire in the kitchen! " she called. " I shall be 
nice and warm then. You wouldn't come with me the last four evenings 
when I asked you to, so I shan't come with you now ! ' 

" Oh, fairy doll, don't be so silly! " begged the golliwog, shouting 
through the letter-box. :< Let me light the fire for you, and get it going 
properly. Then I will sit with you in the kitchen and talk, because there is 
no lesson to-night." 

But the fairy doll wouldn't open the door. 
She took down the matches and struck one. It 
went out. She struck another and the lighted 
head flew off, and fell on to her gauzy frock. 

And, oh dear, oh dear! the pretty frock 
caught fire at once and blazed up. The fairy 
doll was on fire! She screamed. " Help! 
Help! I'm on fire! Oh, help, help!" 

The golliwog looked in at the kitchen win- 
dow, horrified. He saw the fairy doll alight. He 
threw up the window and jumped in, trying to 
remember what the nurse doll had taught him. 

" I must wrap her round in a blanket or a 
rug ! " thought the golliwog. He looked round 
the room. There was no blanket but on the 
floor was a hearth-rug. The golly caught it up 
and ran to the doll. He wrapped it all round 
her as tightly as he could, smothering the flames 
and putting them out. 

21 




He shouted through the 
letter-box. 




He wrapped it all round her. 



THE GOLLIWOG WHO LISTENED 

When he was quite sure they 
were out, he unwrapped the poor, 
sobbing fairy doll. He carried her 
gently to bed and gave her hot- 
water bottles. He wrapped her in 
a blanket he had warmed by the fire, 
and he gave her a drink of hot milk. 
Soon the nurse doll arrived for 
the golly had shouted for her to 
come and very soon she had ban- 
daged the fairy doll well, and everything was all right. 

" Golly, I am proud of you," said the nurse doll, when she went. 

" You remembered everything I told you. You saved the fairy doll's life. 

She has been very foolish, for she would not come to my lessons but you 

were wise." 

The fairy doll was so grateful to the golliwog. She slipped her hand 

into his black one and blinked up at him with tearful eyes. 

" I'm sorry I was silly and unkind and rude," she said. " I am 

ashamed of it now. Please forgive me, Golly. You were right to go to the 

lessons and I was wrong not to. If you hadn't gone, and hadn't learnt what 

to do, you wouldn't have known how to save me and I would have been 

burnt. Please forgive me." 

" Of course I forgive you, fairy doll," said the kindly golliwog. " But 

do remember that if you are stupid you get punished for it sooner or later. 

I think you had better let me come and live in the dolls' house with you, 

and teach you to be wise. I can look after you then, and see that 

nothing happens to you." 

So he had his way after all, and 

now he lives in the dolls' house 

with the pretty fairy doll, who is 

quite better, and very much nicer. 

Wasn't it a good thing the golly 

learnt his lessons well? Perhaps 

you will remember his lessons too, 

and maybe one day they will come 

in useful to you! 




She slipped her hand into his black one.

Slip-Around's Wishing Wand 

ONCE upon a time there was a great magician called Wise-one. He was 
a good magician as well as a great one, and was always trying to find 
spells that would make people happy and good. 

But this was very difficult. He had made a spell to make people happy 
but not good as well. And he had found a spell that would make them 
good but not happy too. It wasn't any use being one without the other. 

Now one day he found a marvellous way of mixing these two spells 
together but he hadn't got just one thing he needed. 

" If only I had a daisy that had opened by moonlight, I believe 
I could just do it ! " said Wise-one, as he stirred round a great silvery mix- 
ture in his magic bowl. '' But whoever heard of a moonlight daisy? I 
never did! ' 

Now just at that moment, who should peep into his window but Slip- 
Around the brownie. When he heard what Wise-one was saying, his eyes 
shone. 

' Wise-one, I can get a daisy that has opened in the moonlight," he said. 

" What! " cried Wise-one, in delight. " You can! Well, there's a 
full moon to-night pick it for me and bring it here." 

" What will you give me if I do? " asked Slip- Around. 

:( Oh, anything you like! " said Wise-one. 

" Well, will you give me your wishing-wand? " asked Slip- Around, 
at once.

SLIP-AROUND'S WISHING WAND 

" How do you know anything about 
my wishing-wand? " said Wise-one. 

" Oh, I slip around and hear things, 
you know," said the brownie, grinning. 

"You hear too much," grumbled 
Wise-one. " Well, as I said you could 
have anything, you can have that 
but only if you bring me the daisy! " 

Slip- Around ran off. He meant to 

He glued the petals together. P la ? a trick on the magician! He didn't 

know where any daisies were that opened 
in the moonlight but he knew how to make a daisy stay open! 

He picked a fine wide-open daisy, with petals that were pink-tipped 
underneath. He got his glue-pot and set it on the fire. When the glue was 
ready he took the daisy in his left hand and a very fine paint-brush in his 
right. 

Then, very daintily and carefully Slip-Around glued the petals 
together so that they could not shut. He put the daisy into water when it 
was finished and looked at it proudly. Ah! That would trick Wise-one 
all right! He would get the wishing-wand from him and then what a 
fine time he would have! 

When night came the daisy tried to shut its petals but it could not, 
no matter how it tried, for the glue held them stiffly out together. So, 
instead of curling them gently over its round yellow head, the daisy had 
to stay wide open. 

Slip- Around looked at it and grinned. He waited till the moon was 
up, and then went to Wise-one's cottage with the wide-open daisy. The 
magician cried out in surprise and took the daisy eagerly. He put it into 
water. 

" Good ! " he said. " I'll use that to-morrow it's just what I want 
for my spell." 

" Can I have the wishing-wand, please? " said Slip- Around slyly. He 
didn't mean to go away without that ! 

Wise-one unlocked a cupboard and took out a shining silvery wand 
with a golden sun on the end of it. He gave it to Slip- Around. 

" Use it wisely," he said, " or you will be sorry! " 

24 



SLIP-AROUND'S WISHING WAND 

Slip- Around didn't even say thank-you! He snatched the wand, and 
ran off at once. He had got a wishing- wand ! Fancy that ! A real wishing- 
wand that would grant any wish he wanted ! 

He danced into his moonlit village, shouting and singing, " Oh, I've 
got a wishing- wand, a wishing- wand, a wishing- wand ! ' 

People woke up. They came to their windows and looked out. 

" Be quiet, please! " called Higgle, the chief man of the village. 
" What do you mean by coming shouting like this in the middle of the 
night! " 

"Pooh to you! " shouted Slip- Around rudely. " Do you see my 
wishing- wand? I got it from Wise-one!" 

Nobody believed him. But all the same they leaned out of their 
windows and listened. Higgle got very cross. 

" Go home! " he shouted to Slip- Around. " Be quiet or I'll have 
you punished in the morning! ' 

" Oh no, you won't! " cried Slip- Around boastfully. " I can wish 




An elephant appeared round the corner of the street. 



SLIP-AROUND'S WISHING WAND 

you away to the moon if I want to ! I know what I will do I'll wish for 
an elephant to come and trample on the flowers in your silly front garden ! 
Elephant! Come! " 

Then, to every one's immense astonishment an elephant appeared 
round the corner of the street in the moonlight and began to walk over 
Higgle's lovely flowers. How angry he was ! 

Soon the folk of the village were all out in the street, in dressing- 
gowns and coats. They watched the elephant. 

" That is very wrong of you," said Dame Toddle to Slip- Around. 

" Don't interfere with me! " said the brownie grandly. " How would 
you like a giraffe to ride on, Dame Toddle? Ha ha ! Good idea ! Giraffe, 
come and give Dame Toddle a ride! ' 




When the bear pushed him in play, he fell right over. 

26 



SLIP-AROUND'S WISHING WAND 

At once a giraffe appeared and put the astonished old woman on its 
back. Then very solemnly it took her trotting up and down the street. 
She clung to its neck in fright. Slip-Around laughed and laughed. 

" This is fun ! " he said, looking round at everybody. " Ha ha you 
didn't think I really had a wishing- wand, did you ! Now where's Nibby 
he scolded me the other day. Oh, there you are, Nibby! Would you like 
a bear to play with? ' 

" No, thank you," said Nibby at once. 

' Well, you can have one," said Slip-Around. " Bear, come and 
play with Nibby! ' 

Up came a big brown bear and tried to make poor Nibby play with it. 
Nibby didn't like it at all. When the bear pushed him in play, he fell 
right over. 

" Now just stop this nonsense," said Mister Skinny, stepping up to 
Slip- Around firmly. " If you don't, I shall go to Wise-one to-morrow and 
tell him the bad things you have done with the wishing- wand." 

" Ho ho ! by that time I shall have wished Wise-one away to the end 
of the world ! " said Slip- Around. " You won't find him in his cottage ! 
No he'll be gone. And I shall wish myself riches and power and the 
biggest castle in the land. And I've a good mind to make you come and 
scrub all the floors, Mister Skinny! ' 

" Hrrrrumph! " said the elephant, and walked into the next-door 
garden to tramp on the flowers there. It was Mister Skinny's. He gave a 
yell of rage. 

" Mister Skinny, I don't like yells in my ear," said Slip-Around. 
" You yell like a donkey braying. I'll give you donkey's ears ! There ! 
How funny you look! ' 

Mister Skinny put his hands to his head. Yes he now had donkey's 
ears growing there. He turned pale with fright. Every one began to look 
afraid. It seemed to be quite true that Slip- Around had a real wishing- 
wand. What a dangerous thing for a brownie like him to have! 

The little folk tried to slip away unseen, back to their houses. But 
Slip- Around was enjoying himself too much to let them go. 

" Stop ! " he said. " If you don't stay where you are, I'll give you all 
donkey's ears yes, and donkey's tails too ! ' 

Every one stopped at once. Slip- Around caught sight of Mister 

27 



SLIP-AROUND'S WISHING WAND 




Yes he now had donkey's ears growing there. 

Pineapple the greengrocer. " Ha! " said the brownie, " wasn't it you that 
gave me a slap the other day? " 

" Yes," said Mister Pineapple bravely. " I caught you taking one of 
my apples, and you deserved to be slapped." 

" Well, I wish that every now and again a nice ripe tomato shall fall 
on your head and burst," said Slip- Around. And immediately from the air 
a large ripe tomato fell on to the top of Mister Pineapple's head and burst 
with a loud, squishy sound. Mister Pineapple wiped the tomato-juice out 
of his eyes. Almost at once another tomato fell on him. He looked up in 
horror, and moved away but a third tomato fell from the sky and got 
him neatly on the top of his head. 

Slip- Around began to laugh. He laughed and he laughed. He looked 
at the great elephant, and laughed. He looked at poor Dame Toddle still 
riding on the giraffe, and laughed. He looked at Nibby trying to get away 
from the big playful brown bear, and laughed. He laughed at Skinny's 
donkey-ears. In fact, he laughed so much and so loudly that he didn't 
hear some one coming quickly down the street. He didn't see some one 
creep up behind him and snatch at the wishing- wand ! 

" Oooh! " said Slip- Around, startled. " Give me back my wand or 
I'll wish you at the bottom of the village pond ! " 

Then he began to tremble for who was standing there, frowning 
and angry, but Wise-one, the great magician himself! 

28 



SLIP-AROUND'S WISHING WAND 

" You wicked brownie ! " said Wise-one sternly. " You gave me a 
daisy whose petals were glued open so that it couldn't shut not a real 
moonlight daisy. I have spoilt my wonderful spell. You have no right 
to the wishing- wand. I shall take it back with me." 

" Oh, why didn't I wish you to the end of the world when I had the 
chance ! " wailed Slip- Around. " Why didn't I wish for riches and power 
and a castle instead of playing about with elephants and giraffes and 
things! " 

" Great magician! " cried Mister Skinny, kneeling down before 
Wise-one. " Don't go yet. Look what Slip- Around has wished for! Take 
these things away from us! ' 

Wise-one looked around in astonishment and saw the bear and the 
elephant and the giraffe, and the donkey's ears on poor Skinny's head, and 
the ripe tomatoes that kept falling, squish, on to Mister Pineapple. 

" I'll remove them from you" he said to the listening people, " but 
I'll give them to Slip- Around. He will perhaps enjoy them! " 

He waved the wand and wished. The elephant at once went to Slip- 
Around's garden and trampled his best lettuces. The giraffe let Dame 
Toddle get off and went into Slip-Around's house, where he chewed the 
lampshade that hung over the ceiling light. The bear romped over to the 
frightened brownie and knocked him down with a playful push. 

The donkey's ears flew from Mister Skinny to Slip- Around and lo 
and behold! the ripe tomatoes began to drop down on the surprised 
brownie, one after the other, till he was quite covered in tomato-juice! 

" You've got what you wished for other people," said Wise-one 
with a laugh. " Good-night, every one. Go back to bed." 

They all went home and got into bed, wondering at the night's 
strange happenings. They were soon asleep all except Slip- Around. He 
had the elephant, the giraffe, and the nuisance of a bear in his cottage with 
him and it was terribly crowded ! His donkey-ears twitched, and he had 
to wipe tomato off his head every minute. How unhappy he was ! 

Poor Slip- Around ! He had to sleep under an umbrella at last, and the 
giraffe ate up the tomatoes that fell down plop! The elephant snored like 
a thunderstorm, and the bear nibbled the brownie's toes for a joke. It was 
all most unpleasant. And somehow I think that Slip-Around won't try 
to cheat any one again! What do you think?

The Bumble-bee and the Rabbit 

THERE was once a large round bumble-bee who flew from flower to 
flower on the sunny hillside. His coat was velvety and his hum was 
loud. He was a beautiful bee, and very happy. 

One day he flew into a spider's web. The spider crouched under a 
leaf, fearful of going near the bee and hoping that he would free himself. 
The spider did not like either bees or wasps in her web. Sometimes, if the 
wasp or bee was small, she cut the web around them so that they dropped 
to the ground and crawled away to clean their wings. But she did not 
like to go near this great bumble-bee. 

The bee was afraid. He did not like the feel of the sticky web around 
his wings. He tried to fly away but he flew into more of the web, and 
soon he could not work his wings at all. 

The spider watched. Suppose the bee could not get away? He would 
soon tire himself out and then she could kill him. She stayed under 
her leaf, watching with all her eight eyes. 

A sandy rabbit, hearing the anxious buzz made by the bee, ran up to 
see what the fuss was about. He was astonished to see the bee caught in 
the web. The bee saw him and called to him. 

" Help me, rabbit! I am caught here! If you could break the web for 
me I should drop to the ground and be able to clean my wings and fly. 
Please help me ! ' The rabbit went closer. He lifted his paw and broke 
the web. The bee fell to the ground. He cleaned his wings carefully and 
spoke to the kind little rabbit. 



THE BUMBLE-BEE AND THE RABBIT 

" You are good," he said. " I am only a little thing and may never be 
able to repay you for your kindness, but I thank you with all my heart! r 

The rabbit laughed. " It was nothing," he said. " As for repaying 
me, that you can never do, little bee. You are so small and I am so big 
a tiny creature like you cannot help a rabbit. I do not want to be repaid. 
Fly off in peace." 

The bee soon flew off with a loud buzz. The rabbit went back to his 
play. The spider carefully mended her web, and hoped she would catch 
no more bees. 

The days went by. The bee was careful to look out for webs, and did 
not go near them. The sandy rabbit played happily about the hillside. 

He didn't know that a red fox was watching him each morning, 
hoping that he would go near to the bush under which he was hiding 
then the fox would pounce out, and the rabbit would be caught! 

The sandy rabbit did not know that any fox was near. He and his 
friends played merrily each evening and morning. And one morning 

he went near to the fox's bush. 

The fox lay still. He hardly 
breathed. He kept his eyes on the 
fat little sandy rabbit. He looked 
round. No one was near to help 
him. The rabbit's father and 
mother had gone down their holes. 
The shepherd-boy was not yet up. 
There was no one to save the 
little rabbit. 

A large bumble-bee came sail- 
ing by, up early because the sun 
was warm. He settled on a late 
blackberry flower to get the honey. 
The flower was not far from the 
fox. In alarm the bee suddenly saw 
the fox's sharp eyes looking at him. 
He flew up into the air, won- 
dering why the fox was hiding. 
He lifted his paw and broke the web. He took a look round and then 




THE BUMBLE-BEE AND THE RABBIT 




saw his friend, the sandy rabbit, playing very near oh, much too near 
that thick blackberry bush! 

" The fox is waiting to catch the rabbit ! " thought the bee, in fear. 
" How can I save him? He was so kind to me ! ' 

He saw the fox stiffen ready to pounce. Straightway the bee flew 
down to the sharp nose of the red fox. He dug his sting into the fox's 
nose and then flew off in a hurry. 

The fox barked in pain as the bee stung him, and swung his head from 
side to side, rustling the bush. The sandy rabbit heard and in a trice he 
was off to his hole, his little white bobtail bobbing up and down as he 
went, a danger-signal to all the other rabbits there. 

"Fox! " he cried, "redfox! " 

The fox knew it was no good waiting any longer. He would never 
catch the rabbit now that he knew his hiding-place. He slunk off, furiously 
angry with the bee. But the little bee was pleased. " I am only small," 
he hummed, " but I can do a kind turn as well as anybody else. You did 
not know I should save your life one day, rabbit, when you saved mine ! 
Little creatures can often do big things." 

The bumble-bee was quite right, wasn't he!

GREEN-EYES was a large black cat with the biggest, greenest eyes you 
can imagine. He belonged to the witch Tiptap, and, like all witch's 
cats, he had to help her with her spells. 

Green-eyes had an easy life, for he had nothing to do except come 
when the witch called him, and help her to stir her magic bowl, or sit 
patiently inside a magic ring whilst she muttered queer spells. He had 
plenty of good food fish, milk and sometimes, cream. 

He loved cream, and thought he didn't get enough of it. 

' e I ought to have cream each day," he said to himself. ' :< I am a hard- 
working witch-cat, and I think my mistress should buy me at least three 
pennyworth of good rich cream each day. But no she gets it once a 
week, and that's all. Mean creature." 

" What is the matter, Green-eyes? " asked the witch who saw the cat 
sulking in the corner. 

" I think you should buy me more cream," said the cat gloomily. 

" Nonsense ! " said the witch, sharply. " How dare you talk like that, 
Green-eyes. You have a fine life with me no mice to catch, nothing 
to do except to give me a little help sometimes. I am really ashamed of 
you." 

Green-eyes twitched his fine whiskers and did not dare to say another 
word. But he thought a great deal. He wished and wished he could make 
Tiptap give him more cream, but he could not see how to do it. And 
then one day he had an idea. 

Tiptap called him to help her with a spell. It was a strange piece 
of magic she was doing. She took a broken piece of china and put it into 
her big magic bowl. She called Green-eyes to stir it and he did so. 
Then Tiptap muttered the enchanted words, and the tiny piece of china 

53 




GREEN-EYES' MISTAKE 

grew slowly into a beautiful little 
milkjug. The witch took it out 
of the bowl and set it on the 
table. 

She sent Green-eyes for a 
lemon from the larder. From the 
lemon she took a little piece of 
peel and one pip. These she 
dropped into the jug. 

" Pour lemonade, little jug," 
she commanded. And then, to 
Green-eyes' surprise, the small jug 
lifted itself into the air and poured 
lemonade into a glass that the 
witch had put near. Green-eyes 
looked into the jug in amaze- 
ment. There was no lemonade 
there only the pip and the bit of 
lemon skin hopping about. And 
yet the lemonade certainly came from the jug. 

" This is a fine enchanted jug," said Tiptap, pleased. " I shall sell it 
to the wizard to-morrow. He is coming to call on me." 

She drank the lemonade herself, and said it was very good. Then she 
took a tea-leaf from her tea-caddy, a grain of sugar, and a spot of milk and 
put them in the jug, first taking out the pip and lemon skin. 

" Pour tea, little jug," she said. And at once the jug tilted itself up and 
poured out a steaming hot cup of tea. There was just the right amount of 
milk in, and of sugar too. Green-eyes tasted some that Tiptap poured for 
him into a saucer, so he knew. 

" I shall be able to sell that jug for twenty golden pounds," said Tip- 
tap, pleased. She set the jug on the dresser and went to wash her hands. 

" I am going out to tea this afternoon, Green-eyes," she said. 
" You must keep house for me. Sit by the fire and listen for the 
door-bell in case anyone comes." 

Now as soon as Tiptap had gone, Green-eyes thought of a fine 
idea. If he took that jug for himself, and hid it somewhere, he could 



Pour lemonade," she commanded. 



GREEN-EYES' MISTAKE 




He ran upstairs with the jug. 



make it pour out cream for him 
whenever he wanted some! Oh, 
what a fine idea. 

"But where shall I hide the 
jug ? " wondered Green-eyes. " I 
know. I will hide it behind the 
bath in the bathroom upstairs. I 
can take my dish up there, and no 
one will ever know. Ho, ho. I'll 
have cream now whenever I want 
it." 



The naughty cat first of all took his dish upstairs and put it behind the 
bath, then he went to fetch the jug. It was difficult for him to reach, but 
he managed it. He pushed a chair to the dresser, jumped up on it, leapt on 
to the dresser, and took the jug-handle in his mouth. Then, very carefully, 
he jumped down to the floor again and ran upstairs with the jug. The next 
thing to get was a drop of cream. But was there any in the larder? Green- 
eyes didn't think so. Down he ran again and went to the larder. 

He stood up with his front paws on the shelf and sniffed round. No 
there was no cream but wait a minute there was a bowl of milk there, 
and on the top of it was a layer of cream, for the milk was very rich. 

" Good," thought Green-eyes, pleased. He took a spoon and scraped 
off a drop of cream. Then upstairs he went once more, and emptied the 
spot of cream into the magic jug. 

There it was, at the bottom of the jug. Green-eyes felt excited. He 
spoke to the jug. 

" Pour cream, little jug," he said. At once the jug tilted itself up, and 
a steady stream of rich cream fell into the bowl. Green-eyes licked it up 
as fast as it poured in. 

And just at that very moment, the door-bell rang. 

" It's only the washing come back," said Green-eyes to himself. 
" I'll just pop downstairs and get it, and then hurry back here. The 
bowl will be full again by then." 

So, leaving the jug still pouring cream steadily into his bowl, 
Green-eyes ran down the stairs at top speed. He opened the front 
door, thinking to see the girl who brought back the washing but 

35 




Is your mistress in ? " 



GREEN-EYES' MISTAKE 

instead he saw the wizard who 
often came to pay a call on Witch 
Tiptap. 

" Is your mistress in? " asked 
the wizard, walking into the hall. 

" No, sir, she is out to tea," 
said Green-eyes. 

" Well what a nuisance," 
said the wizard. " I want to write 
a letter. Where's the paper and 
ink?" 

" In here, sir," said Green-eyes, 
running before the wizard into the 
little parlour. " You will find all 
you want here." 

He was just running upstairs 
when the wizard called him. 

" Ho, Green-eyes. There is no 
ink in the inkstand." 



Green-eyes did not dare to keep the wizard waiting, for he had 
a very hot temper. So down he ran, and tore into the kitchen to get 
the big ink-bottle. He filled the inkstand, and went off again. But 
he was only half-way up the stairs when the wizard shouted for him 
again. 

" What do you want to keep running off like that for? Come 
here. The nib in this pen is rusty." 

' Tails and whiskers, that 
cream will be running over," said 
Green-eyes in a panic. " What a 
mess it will make. I'll have to clear 
it up before Tiptap comes home." 

He ran to the kitchen drawer 
and got out the box of nibs that he 
knew was kept there. He chose one, 
and gave it to the wizard. Then off 

he went again, running Upstairs. Green-eyes, will you come here." 

36 




GREEN-EYES' MISTAKE 

But before he could reach the bathroom the wizard called him again. 

" Green-eyes ! Green-eyes ! Bless us all, why does that cat disappear 
like this ? Doesn't he like my company ? Green-eyes, will you come here ? 
There are. no envelopes at all. How can I write a letter without an envelope 
to put it in?" 

Poor Green-eyes. He fled downstairs again, and found the angry 
wizard some envelopes. He was just going to slip out of the door once 
more when the wizard looked at him sternly. 

" Why do you keep running off like that? " he asked. " Have you 
something so important to do? ' : 

" N-n-n-n-n-no," stammered Green-eyes, not knowing quite what 
to say. 

" Then stay here," said the wizard, beginning to write his letter. 
" I'm tired of calling you whenever I want anything. Sit down in that 
chair where I can see you, and don't disturb me by running upstairs again." 

Green-eyes sat meekly down in the chair. Presently the wizard 
became interested in his letter, and 
his head bent so low that his nose 
almost touched the paper. Green- 
eyes felt quite sure he could not see 
him so, very quietly, he slid out 
of the chair, crept out of the door 
on velvet paws, and shot up the 
stairs as if a hundred dogs were 
after him. 

And just outside the bathroom 
door he saw something that made 
his heart sink down into his paws ! 
Cream was leaking out under the 
door! 

" The bowl has overflowed, 
and the cream is all over the 
floor ! " thought poor Green-eyes. 
"Oh, my! What shall I do? I 
simply must go into the bathroom 
and stop that jug." 




He glanced up the stairs. 



37 



GREEN-EYES' MISTAKE 

"Green-eyes! Green-eyes! Bless me if that cat hasn't done his dis- 
appearing trick again! " suddenly shouted the wizard from downstairs. 
Green-eyes was so startled that he fell over, rolled to the top of the 
stairs, lost his balance there and fell headlong down to the bottom. The 
wizard rushed out of the parlour when he heard the noise, and stood in 
amazement when he saw Green-eyes rolling down the stairs. 

" Is this a new sort of game you are playing, Green-eyes? " asked the 
wizard. " A poor sort of game, I should think ! You must be covered 

with bruises! I want a stamp for my 
letter. Come and get me one, and then, 
stars and moon, if you move out of my 
sight again, I'll turn your whiskers into 
snakes! ' 

Green-eyes shook and shivered. He got 
the wizard a stamp and then sat down meekly 
in his chair again. This time the wizard kept 
a sharp eye on him. 

' Tell me if you feel you badly want to go 
and fall down the stairs again, won't you?" he 
said, licking the stamp. " What an extra- 
ordinary cat you are ! I wouldn't keep you for 
five minutes, if I were Witch Tiptap ! You 
haven't any manners at all! Grrrrrrrr! " 

He growled so much like a dog that 
Green-eyes shook like a jelly, and looked 
round to see where the dog was. The wizard 




Green-eyes waded through the 
cream. 



" And now, perhaps, you will get me 
Tiptap's morning newspaper and let me have 
a look at it," he said. " It is raining and I 
shall have to wait here till it stops." 

Oh dear, oh dear, this was worse and 
worse ! How long was the wizard going to 
stay? Green-eyes felt very miserable. If only 
he hadn't meddled with that jug! 

He fetched the newspaper, and, on his 

38 



GREEN-EYES' MISTAKE 

way, he glanced up the stairs. To his horror he saw that the cream was 
dripping from the top step to the next one! It had run out on to the 
landing and was now going to roll slowly down the stairs. 

" Sit down again," said the wizard. " I am not going to have you 
popping in and out of the room. It is most upsetting." 

So Green-eyes sat down. Presently a soft dripping sound was heard. 
The wizard pricked up his ears. 

" What's that noise? " he said. 

" P-p-p-perhaps it's the k-k-k-kitchen tap dripping," stammered 
Green-eyes, not knowing what to say. 

" Go and turn it off then," said the wizard. " A dripping noise 
annoys me." 

Green-eyes shot out of the door, meaning to go upstairs and get the 
magic jug but the wizard heard him going upstairs and roared at him. 

" Does your kitchen tap live upstairs? Go into the kitchen and turn 
it off! " 

So Green-eyes went sadly to the kitchen but, of course, the tap was 
not dripping. Then he went back to the parlour and once more sat down. 

The dripping noise went on. The wizard heard it and looked at 
Green-eyes. 

" Was the kitchen tap dripping? " he asked. 

" No, it wasn't," said Green-eyes. " P-p-p-perhaps it's the kettle 
b-b-boiling over on the stove! ' 

" Go and see," ordered the wizard. Green-eyes went, and outside the 
door he paused. Yes he would tiptoe up the stairs and see if he could do 
it without being heard. But the wizard had ears like a hare and he shouted 
at once. 

" Don't you know your way to the kitchen? " 

And Green-eyes sighed and went into the kitchen but, of course, 
there was no kettle boiling over. He went back, looking very miserable 
for he had seen that the cream had now dripped to the bottom 
step ! The stairs were running with the rich yellow cream what a mess ! 

" I can still hear that dripping noise," said the wizard crossly. " But 
I suppose it must be the rain." 

Green-eyes said nothing and then he saw something that made his 
fur stand up on end! Cream was creeping in under the door! Yes it

GREEN-EYES' MISTAKE 

really was. It had spread over the 
hall and had made its way to the 
parlour. Green-eyes looked at it 
and didn't know what to do. So he 
sat there and just said nothing at all. 
The wizard read his newspaper, 
keeping an eye on Green-eyes all 
the time. Presently the cream 
reached his big feet. The wizard

shuffled them about, and the cream 

swirled round. Green-eyes began to shiver with fright. 

The cream grew deeper and the wizard felt that his feet were cold. He 
looked down and when he saw the cream all round him, he jumped to 
his feet in fright and astonishment. 

" What is all this! " he roared. " What is it? Why, it is cream! Is 
this a joke, you wicked cat? You have been behaving strangely all the 
afternoon creeping away falling down the stairs and now comes this 
cream into the room! What have you been doing? ' 

" Oh, sir, forgive me! " wept the frightened cat. " I stole a magic jug 
of Tiptap's just before you came in, and took it up to the bathroom to hide 
it. Just as I made it pour cream into my bowl, the bell rang and you 
came. I haven't been able to go upstairs to get the jug and stop it from 
pouring out cream and so the cream has come downstairs, and spread 
everywhere! Oh, whatever shall I do? " 

The wizard looked at the cat, and then at the cream. Then he began to 
laugh. What a laugh! It shook all the ornaments on the mantelpiece ! 

" Well, it certainly has its funny side," he said. " First of all, go up- 
stairs and stop the jug pouring out cream. Then come down again." 

Green-eyes waded out of the room through the cream, and up the 
stairs. He waded to the bathroom, and sure enough, there was the little 
magic jug, still pouring away for all it was worth! 

Green-eyes put out his paw and caught hold of it. He shook it twice, 
as he had seen the witch do, and it stopped pouring at once. Green-eyes 
went downstairs again with the jug. 

" Oh, so that's the jug, is it ? " said the wizard. " I'll get Tiptap to sell 
it to me. Now, Green-eyes, set to work, please. I don't like my boots all 

40 



GREEN-EYES' MISTAKE 

messy like this. Lick them clean. You like cream, don't you ? Well, this 
will be a treat for you! My word, you'll have enough cream to last you 
a year! " 

Green-eyes licked the cream off the wizard's boots. It tasted dreadful, 
mixed with boot-polish. Then the wizard said good-bye, took his letter 
with him, and went out of the door, still laughing. 

But poor Green-eyes was left to clear up the creamy mess before his 
mistress came back ! How he worked, poor thing ! He found a mop and a 
broom, and took the biggest pail. Then he began to clean up the cream 
and in the middle of his work Tiptap came back ! 

She stood in the kitchen and looked into the hall and up the stairs. She 
guessed at once what had happened. But Green-eyes confessed too, and 
soon Tiptap knew everything. 

" You are a very naughty, silly, stupid cat," she said sternly. " I have 
a good mind to turn you into a mouse for a month." 

" Oh, no, mistress, not that! " cried Green-eyes at once. " I might 
be caught by a cat! ' 

" You probably would," said the witch, severely. " And I'm not sure 
it wouldn't serve you right. But you are sometimes useful to me, so I will 
not do that. Collect all the cream into pails, dishes and bowls, Green-eyes, 
and you shall have it every day until it is used up. Magic must not be 
wasted and you seem so fond of cream that I am sure you will enjoy it ! ' 

Poor Green-eyes ! He worked hard all the rest of the day, collecting 
the cream into dishes and pails. There were four pails full, and seven 
dishes, so you can guess what a lot there was. Green-eyes had to wash all 
the floors, and clean up the stair-carpet too. He was very tired when he 
had finished. He went to the larder to get himself some milk but Tiptap 
stopped him. 

" No, Green-eyes," she said. " Milk is not good enough for you, is 
it! You must have cream! You may have a dish of the cream." 

" But I don't want it. I've turned against cream, somehow," said 
Green-eyes. 

" Oh, I can't have it wasted," said Tiptap at once. " You must have 
the cream, my dear cat, or nothing at all." 

So Green-eyes lapped up a dish of the cream but oh, how he hated 
it! Then he went to bed. He dreamed of cream and the dishes too, 



GREEN-EYES' MISTAKE 

standing in a row on the kitchen floor! It made him feel ill to see 
them. 

The cream turned sour but still Green-eyes had to lap it, for Tiptap 
meant to teach him a lesson. He groaned and grumbled but not until he 
said that never again would he take anything that wasn't his, did Tiptap 
forgive him. 

" Well, if you really mean that, I'll forgive you," she said. " You need 
not finish up the cream. Go and empty it away, for it really smells dreadful 
now. Let this be a lesson to you, Green-eyes. I will say no more about it." 

She kept her word but, oh dear, whenever the wizard came to see 
Tiptap, how he teased Green-eyes! 

" What's that dripping noise? " he would say. " Oho, Green-eyes, 
have you ever heard that dripping noise again? When are you coming to 
tea with me? Ill have CREAM for a treat. Would you like that? What! 
You don't like cream? Well, well, well, what a surprising cat you are ! ' 

Then Green-eyes would slip away to a corner, and remember the 
dreadful cream-day and from that day to this he has been a good and 
honest little cat. So perhaps it wasn't a bad thing after all! 




ipped up a dish of cream but 
how he hated it !

The Tale of Lanky-Panky 

ONCE upon a time there was a great upset in the land of Twiddle 
because Someone had stolen the Queen's silver tea-service! 

" Yes, it's all gone! " wept the Queen. " My lovely silver teapot! My 
lovely silver hot- water jug! My lovely sugar-basin and milk-jug and 
my perfectly beautiful silver tray! ' 

" Who stole it? " cried every one. But nobody knew. 

" It was kept locked up in the tall cupboard," said the Queen, " and 
it was on the very topmost shelf. Nobody could have reached it unless 
they had a ladder or were very, very tall! ' 

Now among those who were listening were the five clever imps. 
When they heard the Queen say that the thief must have had a ladder or 
have been very tall they all pricked up their pointed ears at once. 

" Ha ! Did you hear that? " said Tuppy. " The Queen said someone 
tall! " 

" What about Mr. Spindle-Shanks the new wizard, who has come to 
live in the big house on the hill? " said Higgle. 

" He's tall enough for anything! " said Pop. 

" I guess he's the thief! " said Snippy. " I saw him round here last 
night when it was dark." 

" Then we'll go to his house and get back the stolen tea-service," 
said Pip. 

" Don't be silly," said the Queen, drying her eyes. " You know quite 
well that if you five clever imps go walking up to Mr. Spindle-Shanks' 

43 



THE TALE OF LANKY-PANKY 

door he'll guess you've come for the tea-service, and he'll turn you into 
teaspoons to go with the teapot, or something horrid like that! " 

" True," said Tuppy. 

" Something in that! " said Higgle. 

*' Have to think hard about this," said Pop. 

" Or we'll find ourselves in the soup," said Snippy. 

" Well, Tve got an idea! " said Pip. 

" WHAT? " cried every one in a hurry. 

" Listen! " said Pip. " I happen to know that the wizard would be 
glad to have a servant someone as tall as himself, who can lay his table 
properly he has a very high table you know and hang up his clothes 
for him on his very high hooks. Things like that." 

" Well, that doesn't seem to me to help us at all," said Tuppy. " We 
aren't tall we are very small and round ! ' 

"Ah, wait!" said Pip. "I haven't got to my idea yet. What about us 
getting a very long coat that buttons from top to bottom, and standing on 
top of each other's shoulders, five in 
a high row buttoning the coat 
round us, and saying we are one 
big tall servant? " 

" What a joke! " said Pop, 
and he laughed. 

" Who's going to be the top 
one, the one with his head out at 
the top? " asked Tuppy. 

" You are," said Pip. "You're 
the cleverest. We others will be 
holding on hard to each other, five 
imps altogether, each holding on 
to each other's legs! I hope we 
don't wobble! " 

" But what's the sense of us 
going like that?" said Snippy. 

" Oh, how stupid you are, 
Snip! " said Pip. " Don't you see 
as soon as the wizard gets out of

All five of them were standing on 
each other's shoulders. 



THE TALE OF LANKY-PANKY 

our way we'll split up into five goblins again, take the teapot, the hot-water 
jug, the milk-jug, the sugar-basin, and the tray one each and scurry 
off!" 

" Splendid! " said Tuppy. " Come on I'm longing to begin! " 

The imps borrowed a very long coat from a small giant they knew. 
Then Pip stood on Pop's shoulders. That was two of them. Then Snippy 
climbed up to Pip's shoulders and stood there, with Pip holding his legs 
tightly. Then Higgle, with the help of a chair, stood up on Snippy's 
shoulders and last of all Tuppy climbed up on to Higgle's shoulders. 

There they were, all five of them, standing on one another's shoulders, 
almost touching the ceiling! Somehow or other they got the long coat 
round them, and then buttoned it up. It just reached Pop's ankles, and 
buttoned nicely round Tuppy's neck at the top. 

They got out of the door with difficulty. Pip began to giggle. " Sh! " 
said Tuppy, at the top. :c No giggling down below there. You're sup- 
posed to be my knees, Pip. Knees don't giggle ! ' 

Snippy began to laugh too, then, but Tuppy scolded him hard. 
" Snippy! You are supposed to be my tummy. Be quiet! We are no 
longer five imps, but one long, thin servant, and our name is is 
is . . ." 

" Lanky-Panky," said Snippy suddenly. Everyone laughed. 

" Yes that's quite a good name," said Tuppy. " We are Lanky- 
Panky, and we are going to ask if we can be the Wizard Spindle-Shanks' 
servant. Now not a word more! ' 

" Hope I don't suddenly get the hiccups ! " said Pip. " I do some- 
times." 

" Knees don't get hiccups! " snapped Tuppy. " Be quiet, I tell you! ' 

The strange and curious person called Lanky-Panky walked un- 
steadily up the hill to the big house where the wizard lived. Tuppy could 
reach the knocker quite nicely, for it was just level with his head. He 
knocked. 

" Who's there! " called a voice. 

" Lanky-Panky, who has come to seek work," called Tuppy. 

The wizard opened the door and stared in surprise at the long person 
in the buttoned-up coat. "Dear me! " he said. " So you are Lanky- 
Panky well, you are certainly lanky enough! I want a tall servant who 

45 



THE TALE OF LANKY-PANKY 

can reach up to my pegs and tables. 
Come in." 

Lanky-Panky stepped in. 
Tuppy, at the top, looked round 
the kitchen. It seemed rather dirty. 

"Yes," said Spindle-Shanks. 
" It is dirty. But before you do any 
cleaning, you can get my tea." 

" Yes, sir," said Tuppy, feel- 
ing excited. Perhaps the wizard 
would use the stolen tea-service! 
That would be fine. 

The wizard sat down and took 
up a book. " The kettle's boiling," 
he said. " Get on with my tea." 

The curious-looking Lanky- 
Panky began to get the tea. There 
was a china teapot and hot- water jug 
on the dresser, but look as he might, 
Tuppy could see no silver one. 

" Excuse me, please, sir," he said politely. " But I can't find your 
silver tea-things." 

" Use the china service! " snapped the wizard. 

" Good gracious, sir ! Hasn't a powerful wizard like you got a silver 
one? " said Tuppy, in a voice of great surprise. 

" Yes I have! " said Spindle-Shanks, " and I'll show it to you, to 
make your mouth water ! Then I'll hide it away again, where you can't get 
it if you wanted to." 

He opened a cupboard and there before Tuppy's astonished eyes 
shone the stolen tea-service on its beautiful tray. 

" Ha! " said the wizard. " That makes you stare, doesn't it? Well, my 
dear Lanky-Panky, I am going to put this beautiful tea-service where you 
can't possibly get it! I am going to put it into this tiny cupboard down 
here right at the back far out of reach so that a great, tall person like 
you cannot possibly squeeze himself in to get out such a precious thing." 

" No, sir, no one as tall as I am could possibly get into that tiny 




The wizard stared in surprise. 



THE TALE OF LANKY-PANKY 

cupboard," said Lanky-Panky, in a rather queer voice. " Only a very 
tiny person could get in there." 

" And as I never let a tiny person into my house, the tea-service will 
be safe," said Spindle-Shanks, with a laugh. :< Now, is my tea ready? ' : 

It was. The wizard ate and drank noisily. Lanky-Panky ate a little 
himself. Tuppy managed to pass a cake to each of the imps without the 
wizard seeing, but it was quite impossible to give them anything to drink ! 

That night, when the wizard was asleep, Lanky-Panky unbuttoned 
his coat and broke up into five little imps. Each one stole to the tiny cup- 
board. Tuppy opened it. He went in quite easily and brought out the tea- 
pot. Snippy went in and fetched the hot-water jug. Pip got the milk-jug. 
Pop got the sugar-basin, and Higgle carried the big, heavy tray. 

They managed to open the kitchen door. Then one by one they stole 
out but as they crossed the yard Higgle dropped the tray! 

Crash ! It made such a noise ! It awoke the wizard, who leapt out of 
bed at once. He saw the open door of the cupboard he saw the open 
door of the kitchen he spied five imps running down the hill in the 
moonlight. 

" Imps! " he cried. " Imps ! How did they get in ? Did Lanky-Panky 
let them in? Lanky-Panky, where are you? Come here at once, Lanky- 
Panky! " 

But Lanky-Panky didn't come. 




Ha 1 " said the Wirard. " That makes you stare, doesn't it ? 

47 



THE TALE OF LANKY-PANKY 




" Lanky-Panky has disappeared ! " he said. ' The imps have killed 
him! I shall complain to the King! " 

The Queen was delighted to get back her tea-service. 

When the wizard came striding to see the King and to complain of 
Lanky-Panky's disappearance, the five clever imps, who were there, began 
to laugh and laugh. 

' Would you like to see Lanky-Panky again? " they asked the sur- 
prised wizard. " Well, watch! " 

Then, one by one they jumped up on each other's shoulders, borrowed 
a big coat from the King and buttoned it round them. 

" Here's old Lanky-Panky ! " they cried, and ran at Spindle-Shanks. 
" Catch the wizard, someone, for it was he who stole the Queen's things, 
though he doesn't know we knew it and that we took them back to her! ' 

So Spindle-Shanks was caught and punished. As for Lanky-Panky, he 
sometimes appears again, just for fun. I wish I could see him, don't you? 




BOBBY had a book all about cowboys. It had pictures in it, showing the 
cowboys galloping about on their horses and lassoing all sorts of 
animals. It was very exciting. 

:e I shall be a cowboy when I grow up," said Bobby. " I think I had 
better practise now. I can play at lassoing things with a rope. And perhaps 
Farmer Straws will let me ride his little pony sometimes." 

But Farmer Straws wouldn't. " No," he said. " I'm not going to 
have any little scamps riding my quiet old Ladybird. You keep out of my 
fields, Bobby! " 

Bobby was disappointed. It was difficult to be a cowboy and not 
have a horse. 

*' I shall ride on the swing-gate instead ! " he said. So he climbed up 
on to the big swing-gate, tied his reins to the gate-post, and galloped there. 
Sometimes the wind swung the gate open and shut, and then it was great 
fun. 

Mother gave Bobby the old clothes-line for a rope to practise lassoing 
with. He was very pleased. 

But the other children laughed at him. " Bobby the cowboy! " they 
said. " Ha, look at him, riding on the gate for a horse, and driving the 
post! And look at his lasso it's just an old clothes-line! ' 

Bobby didn't like being laughed at, but he was a plucky boy, and he 
wouldn't give up fust because somebody laughed at him. He climbed up 
on to the gate once more and clicked to his horse-post! 

And how he practised lassoing! He knew how to make a slip-knot at 

49 



BOBBY THE COWBOY 

the end of his rope. He knew how to gather the rope into loops and send 
it spinning through the air, unwinding as it went. But it was very difficult 
to make the end loop drop over the thing he was aiming at! 

" Bobby tries to lasso the gate-post and he nearly catches a cow! ' 
laughed the other children, watching. " Bobby, try to lasso Rover the 
farm-dog you'll find you've caught the pig instead! ' 

Now it is very difficult to go on doing something when people laugh 
all the time but Bobby wouldn't give up. No; he meant to learn lassoing 
properly and at last he managed it ! It was wonderful to see him aim at a 
lamp-post and see the loop drop neatly over the lamp and slither down to 
the foot of the post! 

" What use is it, anyhow? " mocked Harry, a big boy, who was the 
son of Mr. Straws the farmer. " It's all right if you really live out in the 
Wild West country and have to lasso horses and cows, but what's the use 
of lassoing lamp-posts? ' 

" Oh, you never know when anything may come in useful," said 
Bobby. 

Now one day all the children went down to the river to play. Harry 
took his baby sister with him, a little girl in a push-chair. She was strapped 
in safely so that she couldn't fall out. Kenneth, Elsie, Winnie and Tom 
went too, carrying their boats and balls. They meant to have great 
fun. 

Harry put the baby girl some way back from the river and told her to 
go to sleep. Then he went off to sail his boat with the others. After that 
they went away into the nearby field to play ball. 

Now the wind began to blow hard, and it blew the baby-girl's pram 
along. It blew it down the gentle slope that led to the river, and the little 
girl screamed. 

The farmer, who was working not far off, heard the scream and looked 
up. When he saw his baby girl in the push-chair, running by itself to the 
river, he gave a great shout. He began to run. 

The children heard the scream and the shout, and they were filled with 
horror when they saw the baby-girl going in the push-chair to the river. 

" Shell fall in! " shouted Harry. " Quick! Run! " 

Everybody ran, but it looked as if no one would get there in time. But 
wait a minute what is Bobby doing? He has stopped he has undone the

Whish ! It dropped neatly round the handle of the push-chair. 

lasso-rope he keeps tied around him. He takes it and loops it quickly 
and now it is flying through the air ! 

Whish! It dropped neatly round the handle of the push-chair, just as 
it had reached the river-bank. Bobby pulled the rope tightly, and the loop 
gripped the handle fast. Bobby pulled again. 

The push-chair stopped, and then ran safely backwards up the bank, 
away from the river. The farmer caught the handle and pulled it farther 
back. He undid the strap and took out his frightened little girl. 

All the children ran up, pale and scared. " Is Baby all right? " asked 
Harry. 

5 1 



BOBBY THE COWBOY 

" Yes," said the farmer. " Thanks to Cowboy Bobby! That was a 
wonderful throw of yours, Bobby! You're a real cowboy! " 

All the children stared at Bobby in wonder. So Bobby had been 
right his lassoing had come in useful after all! What a good thing he 
hadn't given it up when they had laughed at him! 

" Bobby, you can ride my pony Ladybird whenever you like," said 
Farmer Straws. " If you want to be a cowboy, you shall ! ' 

" Hurrah! " yelled Bobby, and he ran to find Ladybird at once. 
My goodness, he was soon galloping round the field, for all the world 
like a real live cowboy! 

But the next day was better still, for Mrs. Straws went to town 
and bought a prqper cowboy set shaggy trousers, leather belt, red 
shirt, and cowboy hat. 

Don't be afraid if you hear a wild shout from Farmer Straws' field 
when you go near ! You will see a fierce cowboy galloping on a pony, his 
lasso whirling through the air, the pony's hoofs thundering on the grass. 
It's only Bobby but he looks like a real cowboy now! 




Shaggy trousers, leather belt and hat. 




The Cockalorum Bird 

ONCE upon a time there were two children called Benny and Sarah. 
They lived in a nice house with their father and mother, and they 
went to school from Monday to Friday, just as you do. 

They were rather quarrelsome children, and they were not at all kind 
to animals. 

Rover the dog hated them, for they trod on 
his toes and pulled his tail. Tibby the cat ran 
away when they came, in case her tail should be 
pulled too, or her fur stroked roughly the 
wrong way. Even the birds in the garden flew 
off as soon as Benny and Sarah came out, for 
they were afraid of having stones thrown at 
them. 

Their mother didn't like to see them un- 
kind, but though she scolded them, and often 
read them stories of animals and their friends it 
didn't seem to make any difference. And one 
day ah, something very strange happened to 
Benny and Sarah! 

Every spring the two children used to go 
out bird-nesting although they knew that their 
mother had forbidden them to. They pretended 
to her that they were going to look for prim- 




Even the birds flew off. 



53 




THE COCKALORUM BIRD 

roses, and it is true that they always brought 
back a bunch but they brought back some- 
thing else too! 

Packed away in a box of cotton- wool in 
Benny's pocket were eggs ! Yes, birds' eggs of 
all kinds, from the pretty sky-blue ones belong- 
ing to the little brown hedge-sparrow, to the 
reddish-brown ones of the friendly robin. There 
were thrushes' eggs, too, and blackbirds', and 
sometimes a chaffinch's egg taken from its neat 
and mossy nest. 

When they got home the children blew the 
eggs empty and hid them away on an old shelf in 
the dark summer-house. They had a box there, 
full of eggs dozens of them, often five or six of 
the same kind. Nobody knew but themselves. 
Many, many birds had been frightened and 
made unhappy by the two children, but Benny 
and Sarah cared nothing for that! 
Now one day they set off as usual, carrying their lunch in a satchel. 
" Good-bye, Mother! " they called, " We are going to look for 
violets and primroses! ' 

But really they were going bird-nesting, although the day before at 
school, they had promised their teacher that they would be kind to all 
birds and not rob their nests. Off they went and soon they were beating 
the hedges to make the birds fly out, and once Benny hit a thrush with a 
stone and hurt its leg. 

They took two eggs from a blackbird's nest, and heard the poor 
mother blackbird calling to her mate in terror. They found a robin's nest 
in an old tin and took all the eggs, which made the robins so unhappy that 
they flew about singing of their loss all day long. 

And then they found the strange egg in the strange nest ! 
Benny found it. He was passing an old wall and he caught sight of 
something funny on the top. He climbed up to see what it was and 
there, in a cup-shaped nest made of pine-cones stuck together, he saw 
the strange egg! 

54 



They pulled his tail. 



THE COCKALORUM BIRD 




" And look at the egg I " said Benny. 

He was most astonished to find such a queer nest. He had never seen 
one made of pine-cones before. He called Sarah up to see it. 

" And look at the egg! " he said. " Did you ever see such a curious 
one? It's almost as big as a hen's egg and what a funny shape and 
colour! " 

" It's quite flat one end and very pointed the other! " said Sarah. 
" Why, I believe it would stand up on its flat end ! And oh, Benny isn't 
it strangely marked? ' : 

It certainly was. It was striped in yellow, red and black all the way 
from end to end. Benny picked it up and almost dropped it! 

55 



THE COCKALORUM BIRD 

" Ooh! " he said, startled, " it's very hot! " 

So it was almost as if it had been cooked! Sarah felt it and was 
most surprised. 

" Let's take it home and blow it," said Benny, excitedly. " It will be 
the strangest and rarest egg we've got! " 

So he put it into his box of cotton- wool and slid down from the wall. 
It was almost time to go home, so the two children picked a bunch of 
violets and primroses, in case their mother should wonder what they had 
been doing all the time, and off they went, back home again. 

" I hope you didn't go bird-nesting," said their mother, when she 
saw what looked very much like a box sticking out of Benny's pocket. 

" Oh no, Mother ! " said the children untruthfully. Wasn't it horrid of 
them to tell such a story? But they were not very nice children, you see. 

They went to the old summer-house as soon as they could, and took 
out the strange, striped egg. To their enormous surprise it had changed its 
markings ! Instead of being striped in yellow, red and black, it was now 
spotted with orange and green. It didn't look the same egg at all! 




A brightly coloured bird appeared. 

56 



THE COCKALORUM BIRD 

" I say! " said Benny, rather alarmed. " What's happened to this 
egg? Is it magic, do you think? " 

:< Don't be silly," said Sarah. " You know we don't believe in fairies 
or magic or anything like that. Go on, blow the egg, Benny, and make it 
nice and hollow so that we can put it with our collection." 

Benny took up the egg but he at once let it drop with a loud howl. 

" It's boiling hot! " he cried. " It's burnt my hand! " 

" Yes, and you've broken the egg, you silly stupid boy! " shouted 
Sarah, in dismay. She gave Benny a slap, and he hit her back. Then they 
stopped quarrelling in a hurry for something very strange was happening ! 

The egg had broken, certainly but no yellow yolk had come out. 
Instead a very small and brightly coloured bird appeared in the broken 
shell, opened its beak and gave a piercing whistle, like a railway train! 

The children stared at it in astonishment and alarm. Whatever bird 
could it be? 

As they looked, it began to grow and soon it was as big as a magpie. 
It was a very curious-looking creature, for it had a yellow head with a 
curved beak, bright blue eyes, and striped orange and green feathers with 
a long tail made of one black feather c 

" I don't like it! " said Benny, in a fright. " Come on, Sarah, let's 
go indoors! Perhaps the nasty thing will fly away." 

They left the old summer-house and ran indoors but that bird fol- 
lowed them. It spread its strange, striped wings and flew after them. It 
landed on Benny's shoulder and gave his ear a sharp peck. Then it 
whistled loudly and piercingly and both children jumped in alarm. 

" Stop that dreadful whistling! " called their mother, crossly. 

The children didn't like to say that it was the bird making that noise 
for they were afraid of having to own up that they had been bird-nesting. 
Benny tried to slap the bird, but it flew quickly to Sarah's shoulder, 
bent round and nipped her nose. Then it gave another loud screeching 
whistle. 

" Didn't your mother tell you to stop that noise? " suddenly shouted 
their father's angry voice, and out he came. The bird at once disappeared 
into Benny's pocket, grew very small and kept perfectly still and quiet. 

" You can both go up to bed at once and stay there for the rest of 
the day ! " said their father, crossly. 

57 



THE COCKALORUM BIRD 




How that bird pecked them in bed! 

So up the stairs they went, feeling angry with the screeching bird, 
but not daring to say anything about it. They undressed and got into bed, 
half-frightened. 

" We'd better get rid of that horrid bird," whispered Benny to Sarah. 
" When it's dark to-night I'll take it out-of-doors and lock it in the 
gardener's shed." 

So that night when everything was dark and quiet, Benny crept down 
the stairs, with the bird, hoping that it wouldn't whistle. He took it to the 
gardener's shed, opened the door and pushed it inside. Then quickly he 
slammed the door, locked it, and ran back to bed. 

" It's all right! " he said to Sarah. " It's safely in the shed. Gardener 
will find it there to-morrow, and we needn't say anything about it." 

They fell asleep but two hours later they were awakened by a gentle 
tapping on the window. They sat up. A bird-like voice was calling softly 
to them. 

" Let me in! Let me in! If you don't, I shall whistle again! " 

" Oh my goodness, it's that bird ! " groaned Benny. " It's got out of 
the shed. What are we to do, Sarah ? ' : 

" I'm just going to screech! " said the bird, tapping again. " Oho! 
Then your father will come and whip you both! ' 

In a fright Sarah jumped out of bed, opened the window and let in 
the bird. 

" Many thanks," said the bird, and hopped to their bed. " Come on, 
get in and warm me! I'm cold now, for that shed was damp." 

58 



THE COCKALORUM BIRD 

How that bird pecked them in bed ! He couldn't seem to get comfort- 
able and he pecked first Sarah and then Benny to make them lie just how 
he wanted them to. 

" Are you a magic bird? " asked Benny, feeling very much scared. 

" I'm a Cockalorum Bird," it answered. " You only see us once in a 
blue moon. You are lucky to have found my egg, I can tell you. It's 
hundreds of years since anyone found a Cockalorum egg." 

" Well, I wish we hadn't! " said Benny, miserably. " I think you are a 
most unlucky bird. Please don't make that screeching whistle of yours 
any more." 

Next day the Cockalorum Bird got up with them and hopped into 
Benny's pocket when he was dressed. It seemed to be able to make itself 
as big or as small as it wished. It was really most peculiar. 

The children went to school. 
The bird snuggled down in Benny's 
pocket and fell asleep. Benny was 
glad. When they came out for play- 
time he had forgotten all about the 
bird. He saw the school cat lying 
on the window-sill in the sun and 
he ran up to her. He caught hold 
of her tail and gave it a sharp pull. 
The cat howled in pain. 

The Cockalorum Bird woke 
up and peeped out. As soon as it 
saw what Benny was doing it hopped up to his shoulder, pecked a small 
piece out of Benny's ear and gave the loudest whistle he had ever made. 
Then another and another! The master came running out angrily 
and looked at Benny. 

" Go in at once! " he said. " You shall miss your playtime, you 
bad boy. Making a noise like that, indeed! ' 

The Cockalorum Bird had flown off. It was nowhere to be seen. 
Benny walked sadly into the schoolroom and sat down. " I wish I hadn't 
pulled that cat's tail! " he thought. 

Sarah was sorry that Benny was missing his playtime. She went out by 
herself and saw a dog outside the playground railings. She picked up a

ear and gave the loudest whistle. 



THE COCKALORUM BIRD 

stone and threw it. At once she felt two sharp-clawed feet on her shoulder, 
and there was the Cockalorum Bird again ! It pecked her on the nose and 
then screeched harshly. 

The teacher at once sent the little girl indoors, though Sarah sobbed 
and said she really hadn't made the noise. " It was the Cockalorum Bird," 
she wept. 

"Don't tell such stupid stories!' said the teacher, impatiently. 
"There's no such bird! " 

The Cockalorum Bird had flown off again. Sarah couldn't see it any- 
where. She went in and sat down in the schoolroom with Benny. The two 
children looked at one another gloomily. 

" We shall have to get rid of that nasty bird somehow \ " said Benny. 
" I think I'll throw it down the well to-night. I'll put the lid on the well 
so that it can't possibly get out again." 

But the Cockalorum Bird didn't come back that morning, and the 

two children cheered up. Perhaps 
it wouldn't come back any more. 
How lovely ! 

After tea they went to play in 
the garden. One of the next-door 
hens crept under the fence and 
Benny saw it. In delight he began 
to chase it all over the place, and 
the frightened creature ran squawk- 
ing here and there. 

Suddenly there was a loud 
whistle and down flew the Cocka- 
lorum Bird on to Benny's shoulder. 
It tweaked first one of his ears and 
then the other. Then it screeched 
again, more loudly than six railway 
trains ! 

Out came their father. "Didn't 
I say you were not to screech like 
that!" he roared. " We shall have 
all the neighbours complaining of 




He ran here and there trying to escape 
his father.

THE COCKALORUM BIRD 

you. Well, I warned you last night. 
Now I shall whip you, Benny." 

Benny was frightened. He 
ran here and there in the garden, 
trying to escape from his father. 
Sarah watched and thought that 
really he looked just like the hen 
he had been chasing a few minutes 
since. His father caught Benny at 
last, gave him a good whipping 
and sent him indoors. 

:< And if you start any tricks, 
you'll have the same punishment ! " 
he said to Sarah. The little girl 
looked round nervously for the 
Cockalorum Bird, hoping that it 
wouldn't screech and get her into 
trouble, but it seemed to have 
disappeared. 

She took a book, sat down on 
the grass and began to read. 
Presently she saw a spider hanging from her web nearby, mending a little 
hole in it. Sarah watched. When the spider had finished her mending she 
ran back to a leaf and hid there. Then Sarah did an unkind thing. She 
took a twig and made a big hole in the web so that the spider would have to 
mend it all over again. She and Benny were always doing things like that. 
No sooner had she done this than she felt something on her shoulder, 
and there was the Cockalorum Bird again, looking out of bright blue eyes 
at her. He opened his beak and gave a loud screech. 

Sarah's mother came to the door. " It's a good thing your father has 
gone out to buy a paper," she said, crossly, " or he would most certainly 
have whipped you for that, Sarah. I really can't think what has come over 
you children the last day or two so noisy, so disobedient! Come indoors 
and I will give you some mending to do. I will not have you making those 
horrible, screeching, whistling noises! ' 

So Sarah had to go indoors. Her mother put the mending basket 

61 




Oh, you unkind thing,* cried Sarah, 
in tears. 




THE COCKALORUM BIRD 

before her and told her to darn a 
hole in one of Benny's stockings. 
Sarah was a good darner and she 
set to work to darn the hole neatly 
and then, just as she had finished 
it, in flew the Cockalorum Bird 
again, put its sharp beak down to 
the stocking and tore out all Sarah's 
careful darning! 

" Oh, you unkind thing! ' 
cried the little girl, in tears. 

" I saw you do it to the spider's 
web! " said the Cockalorum Bird 
in his squawking voice. :< If it's a 
nice thing to do to a small spider, 
it's a nice thing to do to a small 
girl! " He opened his beak to give 
a loud screech, but Sarah put her 
hand on his open beak and closed it. 

" Please, please ! " she said. "I 
shall get into such trouble if you screech again." 

Just then her mother came in and the brilliantly coloured bird 
disappeared in a trice. Sarah's mother was cross when she saw that there 
was still a big hole in the stocking. c You naughty girl ! You haven't 
done a scrap of darning ! " she said. " I shall not let you go out to tea 
to-morrow now." 

That night in bed the two children talked in low voices about the 
strange Cockalorum Bird. 

" I've noticed that he always seems to come and screech when we do 
anything unkind," said Sarah. " Perhaps we had better stop doing those 
things, Benny." 

" It would be easier to get rid of that horrid bird ! " said Benny. " I 
shall do what I said, Sarah, and throw it down the well to-night! ' 

Just then the Cockalorum Bird flew in at the door, and sat on the bed 
rail, its long black tail twitching from side to side. " I'm just going to 
sneeze," it said, " and then I believe I've got a screech coming ! ' 

62 



The little boy ran off to the old well. 



THE COCKALORUM BIRD 

In a fright Benny clutched at the bird, wrapped a towel round it so 
that it could not make a sound, or even struggle, and shook it angrily. 

' Well, I'll just drown you now, you nasty, horrid creature ! " he said. 
He climbed out of the window and slid down the pear tree outside. Then 
Sarah threw him down the bundle in which the Cockalorum Bird was 
closely wrapped. The little boy took it and ran of! to the old well. He 
lifted up the lid that covered it, threw the wrapped-up bird quickly down 
the well, and clapped on the lid again. Then back he went. 

" Well, we shan't see or hear that bird any more! " he said, pleased. 
He climbed into bed and it was not long before both children were asleep. 

And then, just as had happened the night before, they were awakened by 
a tapping on the window-pane ! " Let me in, let me in, I am wet and cold ! " 
said the voice of the Cockalorum " Quick, before I whistle and screech! " 

There was nothing for it but to get out of bed and open the window. 
In flew the big bird, and made straight for the children's bed. It cuddled 
up to them and they couldn't bear it, for it was soaking wet and very cold. 
It was angry too, and kept pecking their legs with its sharp beak. 

Sarah began to cry. " What can we do to get rid of this bird ? " she 
sobbed to Benny 

" You utttt get rid of me," said the bird. " Once I find children like 
you, I live with them always. I don't get any fun living with kindly, good- 
natured children. I never get a chance of screeching or pecking them. But 
I shall get a dozen chances a day of teasing you. My, what fun! ' 

The children lay quiet. They were each thinking the same thing. Per- 
haps if they stopped being thoughtless and unkind to other creatures, the 
Cockalorum Bird would find it so dull living with them that he would fly 
offo They would try it, anyhow! 

So the next day they went out of their way to be kind and gentle. 
They took Rover for a walk. They stroked the surprised cat. They put out 
bread for the birds. And the Cockalorum Bird drooped its wings and 
never screeched a screech or pecked a peck. It yawned and waited but 
the children didn't give it a chance to screech or tweak their ears! 

And the strange thing was that both of them were very happy. They 
were pleased to see Rover's joy when he ran beside them on their walk. 
They were glad when the cat purred and rubbed itself against them. They 
laughed to see the sparrows squabbling over the bread they had put out. 

63 



THE COCKALORUM BIRD 

" Do you know, Sarah, it's more interesting to be kind than it is to 
tease things," said Benny, suddenly. 

" It gives you such a nice feeling, too," said Sarah. " We have been 
rather horrid, often, you know, Benny." 

" The old Cockalorum Bird is feeling as dull as can be! " whispered 
Benny. " Let's pull his long tail and make him jump! ' 

" Oh, Benny, no ! Let's go on being kind for as long as we can," said 
Sarah. " Besides, he would screech." 

So they left the bird alone, and he didn't even try to get into bed with 
them at night. 

Benny forgot the next day and threw a stone at a thrush and how 
pleased the Cockalorum Bird was ! How it screeched ! How it tweaked his 

ear ! And the day after Sarah forgot 
and trod on a worm. The Cocka- 
lorum went nearly mad with joy 
and whistled till Sarah's mother 
came out and smacked her hard! 

But the children changed after 
that. They remembered to be 
kind and gentle, and they found 
that they liked it because then all 
the birds and animals trusted them 
and came round to make friends. It was so much nicer to have friends 
than enemies. The Cockalorum Bird grew mopey and one day he spread 
his striped wings and flew off, over the garden-hedge. 
"He's gone," said Benny. 

" I wonder where to? " said Sarah. " Well, Benny, I'm not sorry we 
found his egg. We are much happier now. I don't think we shall ever like 
to be unkind again and go about teasing things. Do you? ' : 
" Never ! " said Benny, And he meant it. 

They didn't see the Cockalorum Bird again. People say it goes about 
looking for horrid children to live with, but I don't know if that's true. 
Anyway, if ever you see a nest made of pine-cones, don't touch the egg 
inside, whatever you do. It might grow into a Cockalorum Bird and live 
with you \ 




The Cockalorum Bird flew off. 




The Magic Shell 



JESSIE and Norman had spent a whole month by the sea and, dear 
me, how they had loved it. They had paddled and bathed and dug 
and fished but now it was all over. 

The children were sad. They sat on a sand-castle for the last time, 
and Jessie was almost in tears. 

" I do love the sea so much," she said. " I don't want to go home." 

" Nor do I," said Norman. " I wish we could take a bit of it back 
with us! " 

" Fd like to take the sound of the waves back with me," said Jessie. 
" I do so love that soft, sighing, singing noise they make, Norman. It's 
a real seaside sound." 

" Let's find a big bit of seaweed to take back," said Norman, getting 
up. " And some shells too, to play with." 

" I don't want to," said Jessie. " If I could take the sound of the 
waves I'd go and look for that. But you can't take that home with you." 

" Well, just come and help me then," said Norman. " If we can find 
a long piece of seaweed we can hang it up outside our bedroom window 
and if it is dry it means good weather, and if it is damp it means bad 
weather. It will be fun to keep feeling it to see! ' 

So the two children began to hunt about for seaweed and shells. Soon 
their buckets were full of pretty shells that shone brightly when they were 
wet. Then Jessie found a very long piece of seaweed. 

65 



THE MAGIC SHELL 

" It's like a mermaid's rib- 
bon! ' she said, holding it up. 
" It's as tall as I am! This will be 
a lovely bit to take home." 

Just then Norman gave a 
shout. " Jessie ! Look at this enor- 
mous shell in the rock-pool here! 
Come and help me to get it. It is 
wedged under a rock." 

The two children tugged at 
the shell and out it came. It was 
indeed a big one very curly and 
long, with a big opening at the 
end. 

" Oh, this is lovely! " said 
Jessie. " We'll put it on the nursery 
mantelpiece when we get home. It 
is a real treasure. If I give you my 
seaweed will you give me this 
shell, Norman? ' : 

" All right," said Norman. So Jessie took the shell and he carried the 
long ribbon of seaweed. They went home, where Mummy was busy 
packing. 

" Oh, dear me, I haven't room for anything else ! " she said, when she 
saw them. " You will have to carry your shells and your seaweed in your 
pails." 

So the two children carried their treasures home themselves. When 
they got home at last, Norman hung the seaweed outside the bedroom 
window and Jessie stood the big shell on the nursery mantelpiece. It 
looked lovely. 

The children did miss the sea. :< It seems so strange not to hear it 
outside the window all day and night," said Jessie. " If only I could hear 
it again! I am so afraid of forgetting the lovely noise the sea makes." 

She looked so very miserable that Mother laughed. " Good 
gracious ! " she said. " What a long face ! Well, you brought plenty of 
sea-treasures home with you. Play with those." 

66 




The two children tugged at the shell. 



THE MAGIC SHELL 




Norman hung the seaweed outside the bedroom window and Jessie stood the 

big shell on the mantelpiece. 

" But what I most wanted to bring was the sound of the sea," said 
Jessie. " I couldn't bring that." 

" Well, that is just what you have brought," said Mother suddenly, 
and she took the big shell down from the mantelpiece. " You have 
brought the song of the sea back in this shell listen ! ' 

She put it to Jessie's ear and do you know, inside that shell she could 
hear the sound of the far-away sea ! Wasn't it marvellous ! She heard the 
little waves sighing and the big ones singing. How delighted she was! 

" Oh, Mummy, Mummy! " she shouted. " The sound of the sea is 
inside my shell! Oh, how lovely! Oh, it's like magic! Now I shall be 
happy because I can hear the sea whenever I want to." 

Wasn't it strange that the shell sang the song of the sea? Would you 
like to hear it too? Then find someone who has a big shell, and ask if you 
can put it to your ear. What a surprise you will get! You will hear the 
sea inside the shell, murmuring and sighing, far, far away. 

It's like magic, isn't it! 




The Greedy Little Sparrow 

FEATHERS was a greedy little brown sparrow who was always first on 
the bird-table and last to go. How he loved the soaked dog-biscuits, 
the potatoes in their jackets, and the scrapings of milk pudding that Hilda 
and Fred put out every morning! 

He wished he could keep all the other birds away from the table so 
that he might have even more to eat. But how could he do that ? 

" I know! " he said at last. " I'll say that the black cat is about. Then 
the others will be careful and I shall be able to eat all I want to." 

So the next morning, when Hilda and Fred put food on their bird- 
table, Feathers began to chirrup loudly to the others. 

" Be careful! Be careful! Chirrup! Chirrup! The cat's about! 
Chirrup! She's hiding under a bush! I saw her! Chirrup! She is waiting 
for us to go on the bird-table and then she will POUNCE! Chirrup! " 

All the birds heard this warning cry and stayed quietly in the bushes 
and on the gutter. Every one was afraid of the cat. No one wanted to be 
caught by Nigger, whose sharp claws could strike down even a big bird 
like Glossy the blackbird. 

' c I'll fly down to the bird-table and see if Nigger is anywhere about 
still! " chirruped Feathers, very soon. " Keep where you are, everybody! 
I'll fly down! " 

He flew down and in a trice was pecking hard at the bread-crumbs 
there. " Chirrup! " he called to the others. " Be careful! I think I can see 
the cat under the lilac bush! I'll tell you when she goes! " 

68 



THE GREEDY LITTLE SPARROW 

Feathers had another good peck at the food, pretending to keep a 
watch for the cat every now and again. The other birds watched him 
hungrily but not one ventured to fly down. They were dreadfully afraid 
of Nigger the cat. 

Then the starling, who had been sitting on the chimney-top warming 
his toes, suddenly gave a splutter. ' Why ! There's Nigger in the next- 
door garden! She can't be hiding under the lilac bush! ' 

Sure enough, when the birds looked, there was Nigger peacefully 
lying in the next garden, asleep in the sun. One by one the birds flew down 
to the table and were soon enjoying a good meal. But Feathers had taken 
all the best titbits, you may be sure. 

The next day Feathers went on with his trick. As soon as Hilda and 
Fred had filled the bird-table with scraps, and the birds had flown down 
to them, Feathers, who was sitting on the gutter, gave a loud chirrup. 

"Chirrup! Chirrup! Fly away quickly ! I can see a tabby-cat round 
by that tub ! He's watching you all ! He's going to pounce ! Chirrup ! ' 
With a flutter of wings and squawks of fright all the sparrows, chaf- 
finches, starlings, and thrushes flew 
off the bird-table. Some went to the 
bushes, some flew to the roof, and 
others were so frightened that they 
flew to the fields. Feathers was 
pleased. He flew down to the bird- 
table at once and called to the 
others: 

" I'll keep my eye on that 
tabby-cat! I can see him from 
here ! I'll tell you when he's gone ! 
Oh, you bad cat, I can see you, yes, 
I can see you! Chirrup, chirrup." 
" Isn't Feathers brave? " said 
a little chaffinch with a bright pink 
chest. 

" He's wonderful the way he 
sees any hiding cat," said a cock- 
They all flew off. Sparrow. 







THE GREEDY LITTLE SPARROW 

" And it's very plucky of him to wait on the table and tell us when 
the cat is gone," said a gleaming starling. " That cat might easily pounce 
on him." 

Feathers heard what everyone was saying and he chirruped in delight 
to himself. He was doing something very mean and here were the others 
praising him and thinking him such a fine, brave fellow. 

" I'm clever, I am," thought Feathers. " They're all stupid. I'm the 
only clever one. See how easily I am tricking them ! I keep them all away 
from the food till I've taken the best." 

He pecked away busily, pretending to keep an eye on the cat all the 
time. Then, when he had eaten all the best scraps, he chirruped to the others: 

" You can come down to the table safely now, for the cat has gone. 
I saw him slink away. He's afraid of me \ ' 

The birds flew down and fed. They were very polite to Feathers, for 
they all thought he was a charming and helpful fellow. 

The next day Feathers spied some cake-crumbs in the next-door-but- 
one-garden. He loved these, for they were sweet. The children had eaten 
their tea in the garden and had left a great many cake-crumbs about. 
Feathers was pleased. 

" Nobody else seems to have seen them," said Feathers to himself. 
" That's lucky. I shan't share them with anyone. I'll just fly down and 
get them." 

As he was about to fly down, a small hen-sparrow chirruped to him 
from the roof: 




The cat really was there. 
70 




THE GREEDY LITTLE SPARROW 

"Feathers! Feathers! Be care- 
ful! There is a big Persian cat in 
the garden! Don't go down for 
those cake-crumbs! " 

" Oho ! " said Feathers to him- 
self, with a quick look round. " So 
there is another sparrow who is 
playing my trick and pretending 
there are cats about so that she can 
get the crumbs herself! No, no, 
little hen-sparrow you can't trick 
me like that. I'm too clever." 

He flew down to the crumbs 
and began to peck them up. The 
little hen-sparrow on* the roof 
hopped up and down in the greatest 
"excitement and fear. " Feathers ! 
The cat is there! Come back, 
come back! Eat the crumbs later 
when the cat is gone! ' 

Feathers took no notice. He 
went on pecking up the crumbs, 

which were really delicious. That little hen-sparrow could be as clever 
as she liked he wasn't going to take any notice. 

But the hen-sparrow was not being clever she was being kind. The 
cat really was there ! And suddenly poor Feathers knew it, for there came a 
soft rustle and the Persian cat pounced on the greedy little sparrow. 

It would have been the end of Feathers if the little hen-sparrow on the 
roof hadn't made such a noise. Lucy, the little girl that the cat belonged to, 
heard the noise and came running out. She made the cat let Feathers go 
and he flew off with a broken leg and no feathers in his tail. 

Poor Feathers! It was a dreadful punishment for greediness and 
untruthfulness. He thought he was so clever but he wasn't even clever 
enough to know that it is foolish to be greedy and to tell untruths. 

If you see a little sparrow with a rather short tail and one limping 
foot, have a look at him. It's sure to be Feathers. 

71 




She made the cat let Feathers go. 



Here Comes Santa Glaus 

A Little Play for a Christmas Party 

A CHRISTMAS party is great fun, isn't it ! We have balloons and crackers, 
lots of good things to eat, games, and perhaps a Christmas Tree. 
Maybe in the middle of the party Santa Glaus arrives to give away 
presents from the tree, or from his big sack. Of course, he is usually 
Daddy or Uncle or Grandpa, dressed up in a red cloak and hood, with big 
rubber boots on, and a fine white beard. 

Here is a little play for two or three boys and girls to act, preferably 
those who are giving the party. As you will see, when you read it, it 
brings Santa Glaus to the party, and this makes a great excitement, especi- 
ally for the little ones, who will probably think that Santa Glaus is quite 
real. 

Characters: 
A BOY, JOHN. 
A GIRL, MARY. 

ANOTHER GIRL (OR BOY), ANNE (OR TOM). 
SANTA GLAUS. 
AN IMP. SERVANT TO SANTA GLAUS. 

The characters can be altered if wished, to all girls or all boys, or may 
be less in number or more than those suggested. In fact, make the charac- 
ters fit your own little family. 

Properties Needed. These are very simple indeed. The scenery is just a 
corner of whatever room you are going to act in. A table, two or three 
chairs are set about. The children are dressed in overalls, which are put 
over their party frocks and suits, hiding them completely. Santa Glaus 
needs the usual red cloak, rubber boots, red hood, and white beard. The 
imp can be dressed in long stockings, and a short tunic of any colour 
wished. He wears a pointed cap with a feather set in it. 

Jingling bells are needed, and someone must be prepared to be outside 
the house, or in the hall to jingle the bells, which are supposed to be 
reindeer bells.

HERE COMES SANTA GLAUS 



THE SCENE: 

A room in an ordinary house just after Christmas. If there is a curtain, or 
screen, draw it aside to show the three child actors all busy together. One is blowing up 
balloons. One is busy making paper chains. The third is making out a list of party 
games, with paper and pencil. 

JOHN (putting down a half-blown balloon): My goodness, you do need a lot of 
puff to blow up balloons. How many shall we want for our party, 
Mary? 

MARY: Oh heaps. Shall I take a turn at blowing up the balloons for you, 
and you take a turn at these paper chains, John? I'm getting rather 
tired of making them for the party. (They exchange chains and a balloon) 
ANNE: I'm thinking of all the games we can play at our party. Blind man's 
buff hunt-the-thimble hunt-the-slipper general post spin-the- 
trencher do tell me some more, you others ! 

MARY: What about nuts-in-May? We always play that to start with. 
ANNE (writing it down): Oh yes. I'd forgotten that. I say, won't it be a 

fine party with all those 
coloured balloons and gay 
paper chains everywhere and 
a lovely Christmas cake with 
candles and a Christmas tree ! 
JOHN: I wish it would hurry up 
and come. I'm longing for it. 
If only we could get Santa 
Claus here too! 

MARY: One of us could have 
dressed up as Santa Claus if 
only we'd had the clothes. 
But we haven't (puffs at a 
balloon). Gracious! This bal- 
loon simply won't blow up. 
ANNE: Think of some more games 
please. Shall we have hide- 
and-seek? 
I'm an imp. I belong to Santa Claus. JOHN: No. That means children 

73 




HERE COMES SANTA GLAUS 

rushing all over the house, and the very little ones get scared. Have 
you put down Musical Chairs? Everyone likes that. 

MARY: Yes, put that down, Anne. Now, let's think of some . . . 

(As she says this, there comes the sound of a bump, off. Then a yell. " Oh, oh, 
oh. 9 ' The children jump in alarm.) 

ANNE: Whatever 's that? It sounded like somebody falling down bump in 
the garden! 

JOHN: And somebody yelling. Hark, there he goes again! 

IMP (off-stage): Oh, oh, oh! What a bump! Oh! 

MARY: Who is it? What can the matter be? 

ANNE: We'd better go and find out. 

(Before she can go, there comes a knock at the door.) 

JOHN: Come in! 

(Enter the IMP, his feathered hat on his head. He looks rather woe-begone, and rubs 
himself behind. He bows to the children, and takes his hat off in a wide sweep.) 

IMP: Hallo to you! Sorry to burst in like this but something awful has 
happened to me. 

MARY (in great surprise): Who are you? You look like an imp, or pixie 
or something! 

IMP (grinning): I'm an imp. I belong to Santa Claus as a matter of fact. 
And, as I said, something awful has happened. 

CHILDREN (together):. What? 

IMP: Well, you see, it was like this. I wanted a ride on a reindeer, so I went 
to the reindeer stable, and jumped on the back of one and off we 
went! And when I wanted him to go faster, he wouldn't. So I 
whipped him, and he threw me off, bump, right down to the ground ! 
I was riding through the sky, you see. 

ANNE: Were you really? You must have had a terrible bump, then! 

IMP (rubbing himself again) : I did. I shall have a great big bruise tonight. The 
thing is that tiresome reindeer has galloped off, back to the stables 
and here am I, not knowing where I am at all or how to get back 
home to Santa Claus's castle. Do you know the way? 

JOHN: No, of course we don't. Haven't you got a wishing-ring or any- 
thing to take you back in a trice? 

IMP: No. (Suddenly looks at Ms hat.) Wait a minute, though my hat 
used to be a wishing hat, because it has a Cockyolly Bird's 

74 



HERE COMES SANTA CLAUS 

feather in it. But it isn't a wishing-hat any more, because I was 

naughty and used the wishes badly. So Santa Glaus said my wishes 

mustn't come true. 
MARY (taking hat and looking at it in excitement): What! Was it once really a 

wishing-hat ! How marvellous ! If only its magic was still in it we 

could all wish wishes! 
IMP (snatching hat away from her): Now don't you start wishing anything, for 

goodness sake ! What I wish won't come true but the magic is still 

there for other people to use. 
ANNE: What, really! Do you mean that if one of us put that hat on, and 

wished, the wish would come true? 
IMP: Yes, it would. You could have one wish each. But you're not going 

to ! People wish such silly things they want sacks of gold and things 

like that. As if they would bring anyone real happiness. 
JOHN (trying to take hat): Oh, let me put it on and wish. Do let me! 
IMP (holding it firmly): Certainly NOT. (Suddenly sees the balloons.) I say! 

What lovely balloons ! Do let me hold one on its string ! (Puts hat 

down, and picks up balloon, and plays with it.) 

MARY (in loud whisper to ]ohn): Get the hat and put it on, quick! 
ANNE: And wish. Go on, John! The imp isn't looking! 

(]ohn snatches up wishing-hat, and crams it on his head, excited.) 
JOHN: What shall I wish? Quick, tell me! 
MARY: Wish for Santa Glaus to come here! Do, do! I've always wanted 

to see him, all real and alive! 
(IMP turns round and sees JOHN with his wishing-hat on his head. Runs to 

grab it, crying, " No, no, don't wish") 
JOHN (fending him off): I WISH SANTA CLAUS WOULD COME HERE 

AND SEE US! 
IMP (sinking down in chair, covering face with hands, and beginning to cry): Oh! 

You've wished a wish and now Santa Glaus will come and he'll see 

me here and know I borrowed one of his reindeer! You mean 

horrid boy! 

ANNE (excited): But will he really come, Imp? I can't believe it! 
IMP: Just stay quiet a minute, and listen. You'll soon hear him. He'll 

come in his reindeer sleigh. 
(All stay quiet, hold their breath, and listen?) 

75 




" Hallo, there 1 Did somebody wish me here ? " 



HERE COMES SANTA CLAUS 

MARY (clutching JOHN'S arm): Listen! I can hear something. 

(A faint tinkling of bells is heard outside the house. It grows louder and louder 

and louder.) 
JOHN: The reindeer bells! It is, it is! 

(Bells jingle very loudly. Then stop. A loud voice cries " Whoa, there, whoa! 

WHOA! ") 
ANNE (loudly): It must be Santa Glaus! 

(The sound of loud feet is heard in the hall. Then comes a bang at the room-door. 

It opens and SANTA CLAUS pops his head in.) 
SANTA: Hallo, there! Did somebody wish me here? 
THE CHILDREN (together): Yes, yes! We did! 
JOHN: Welcome, Santa Claus! 

(SANTA CLAUS strides over to the children and shakes hands with them all, 

beaming. The IMP tries to hide behind chair.) 
SANTA: How do you do, how do you do! Pleased to see you all. Why 

did you wish me here? 
JOHN: Well not for anything special, really. Just to see if you were 

really and truly real! We used the imp's wishing-cap. 
ANNE (plucking it 0,/f JOHN'S head, and putting it on her own): Here's his hat. 

And there's the imp! (Points) 
SANTA: Oh, so it was you, Imp, was it, who borrowed that reindeer of 

mine. How many times must I tell you not to ride the reindeer? 
IMP: Sorry, Santa Claus. Anyway, I've got an awful bump, where I fell 

to the ground. 

SANTA: Serves you right! Well now that I am here, children, is there 
anything I can do for you? What are all these balloons and paper- 
chains for? Going to have a party? 

MARY: Yes, we are. Tomorrow. We were getting ready some of the 
things for it. (A sudden thought strikes her.) Oh, Santa Claus would 
you would you come to our party tomorrow? The children would 
so love to see you! 

SANTA (taking out notebook and looking at it): Tomorrow? No, I'm sorry, 

tomorrow is impossible. I've got to go to a hospital, and give out toys 

to the sick children there. Quite impossible to come here too, I'm afraid. 

ANNE (disappointed): Oh, I wish I do do wish our party was today now, 

this very minute then you'd be here and all our guests would see you. 

77 



HERE COMES SANTA GLAUS 

JOHN (pointing at the wishing-cap on her head): Anne! You've wished! And 

you had the wishing-cap on! 
ANNE (shocked): So I did. I never thought what I was doing. Gracious! 

Will my wish come true? Will our party be today now, this very 

minute? 
(The children suddenly look out to the audience, their guests, as if they now saw 

them for the first time. They clutch one another, and point.) 
MARY: It is the party! Look there's Peter in his best clothes! 
ANNE: And James and Susan and Jane all in party clothes! They're 

looking at us! 
JOHN: They've come to our party! Our wish has come true! Our party 

is today now, this very minute and here in front of us are all 

our guests! 
MARY (looking down at her overall in dismay): But how awful! I haven't got 

any party clothes on only my old overall! I can't be at our party 

dressed like this. But there's no time to change. Everybody's here. 
ANNE (giving her the wishing-hat): Well, take this then, and wish. It's your 

turn to wish. Wish for us all to be in party-clothes, quick! 
MARY (putting on hat): I wish for us all to have on our party clothes! 
(Nothing appears to happen. The three children look down at their clothes, but 

their overalls are still on.) 

ANNE (sadly): The wish didn't come true. What a pity! 
SANTA (beaming, and lifting up ANNE'S overall): Oh yes, it came true. What's 

this I see appearing under your overall? 
ANNE (joyfully): Oh, my blue party frock is here, underneath! It's suddenly 

come, under my overall! My wish came true! 
(She strips off overall, showing pretty party frock below. JOHN and MARY do 

the same. They prance about a little, pleased.) 
SANTA: Well, that's all right ! All your wishes came true. Your party is 

today, not tomorrow you've got your party clothes on, instead of 

your overalls and here am I all ready to do what you want me to do ! 
JOHN: Oh Santa Glaus we'll introduce you to all our guests and then 

will you come and give us the presents off our Christmas Tree? 

Do, do, do! 
SANTA: Anything you like. My imp here can help me. It's time he did a 

little work.

HERE COMES SANTA GLAUS 

JOHN (facing audience): Let me introduce our Christmas friend to you! 
Santa Glaus ! Three cheers for Santa Glaus ! 

(Everyone cheers, audience included. Then SANTA goes down into the audience, and 
makes friends. He then goes with everyone to the room where the Christmas 
Tree stands, or, if there is no tree } sends his IMP into the hall to fetch his sack 
of toys.) 

END OF THE CHRISTMAS PARTY PLAY

Our Own Christmas Crackers 





HAVE you any small presents to give to your family at Christmas time? 
Perhaps you have a thimble for somebody, or a pencil-sharpener, 
or a tiny brooch? Well, instead of wrapping it up in paper, or putting 
in a box, make a Christmas cracker for it! 

It will look pretty on the Christmas breakfast table, and is an amusing 
way of giving the present. I will tell you how to make the cracker. 

You will want a piece of thin white paper for the lining of the cracker. 
Also a bit bigger piece of coloured paper. Red crinkled paper makes 
very pretty crackers, if you can get it. 

Put the white lining paper on the coloured paper, and roll them both 
carefully together, the size of an oiJlnary cracker. See Picture i. 

Now pinch in at one end, and tie round the pinch with some coloured 
thread to hold it in place. Pop the present into your cracker. Pinch in 
the other end, and tie. See Picture 2. Now you have a nice little cracker. 
If you have a coloured scrap, paste it on the front of your cracker to 
finish it off nicely, or cut out a tiny picture and paste that on instead. 

Your cracker won't " pop " of course, though you can pull it and 
let the present out, just for fun! Don't forget to put a nice little message 
in with the present, will you?

The Pig That Went to Market 

ONCE there was a gnome named Mister Snooks. He lived in Tweedle 
Cottage with his little fat pig, Snorter. At least, Snorter wasn't 
supposed to live in the cottage, but as Mister Snooks would leave the back 
door open, and Snorter was very fond of sitting by the fire, it seemed 
as if the little pig was always indoors. 

One day Mister Snooks opened his money-box and found that it was 
quite empty., He didn't know what to do. He was a lazy, forgetful gnome, 
and he really didn't want to go out to work. Oh dear! Why couldn't 
his money have lasted just a little longer! 

:< Oooomph! " said Snorter the pig, walking in at the open kitchen 
door and sitting down comfortably by the fire. 

"Haven't I told you a hundred times you are riot to come indoors ! ' 
shouted Mister Snooks and he shooed the pig out. . But he once more 
forgot to shut the door and after a few minutes Snorter sidled in again and 
sat quietly down on the hearth-rug. This time Mister Snooks didn't notice 
him. He was too busy staring gloomily at his empty money-box. 

Then an idea came into his head. " I will sell Snorter, my little fat 
pig! " he cried. " He will bring me quite a lot of money! Yes that is a 
good idea. What use is he I should like to know? All he does is to eat up 
the scraps for me, and wear a hole in my hearth-rug with sitting on it. I 
will go and fetch him and take him to market this very day! ' 

81 



THE PIG THAT WENT TO MARKET 

He went to the back door and looked out. 

" Snorter, Snorter, Snorter! " he called. " Come here! " 

Well, of course, Snorter was akeady there, sitting by the fire, so he 
didn't move. He just looked round at his master. 

Snooks didn't see the pig. He kept looking out of the door and calling 
angrily: " Snorter! Do you hear me? Where are you? I want you! Come 
here, Snorter! Oh, bless that pig, wherever has he gone? ' : 

" Oooomph! " grunted Snorter, by the fire. 

Snooks turned round and saw him there. " Oh, there you are," he 
said, crossly. " How many times have I told you not to ... still, never 
mind, I'm going to sell you at the market to-day, so you won't be bothering 
me much more by coming and sitting by my fire ! ' 

Snooks put on his hat, coat and scarf, and took a piece of string out of 
the string-box. He tied it round the pig's hind leg and they started off 
together down the street. 




Ho, ho 1 " roared Mister Straw. " That's a good joke 1 " 

82 



THE PIG THAT WENT TO MARKET 

When they came to the bus-stop, Mister Snooks sat down on the seat 
there. It was not quite time for the bus. He tied the pig's leg to the leg of 
the seat, then took out his newspaper and began to read it. When the bus 
came, he folded up his paper and jumped on the bus. He paid his fare 
and opened his newspaper again. 

" The Market! the Market! " shouted the conductor, at last. Mister 
Snooks once again folded up his newspaper and jumped off the bus. He 
walked to the market, and met there a great many farmers, all with cows, 
goats or sheep, talking about the weather and their fields and crops. 

" Good day, Mister Snooks," said one of them. "What have you 
come to market for? Can I sell you a fat goose? ' 

" No, thanks," said Mister Snooks. * I've come to sell Snorter, my 
little fat pig." 

" Where is he? " said the farmer. " I might buy him. I want a nice 
little pig like that >: 

Snooks looked all round him. Snorter was nowhere to be seen. 
" Now where is he? " wondered Snooks. " Let me see, I had him on a 
string." 

" Well, you hadn't got him with you when you came into the market," 
said Mister Straw, the farmer, grinning. " You don't mean to say you've 
come to sell your pig and have left him behind, Snooks ! Ho, ho ! That's 
just like you! ' 

" Well . . ." said Snooks, scratching his head and looking most 
astonished. " I did start out with him, I know. I remember tying him to 
the leg of the bus-stop seat but I don't remember getting him into the 
bus. Bless us all ! If I haven't left him tied up to the seat ! ' 

" Ho, ho! " roared Mister Straw. " That's a good joke! Well, he 
won't come to market by himself, Mister Snooks. You'd better go and 
fetch him! I'll buy him if you bring him." 

Mister Snooks ran to a bus going to his village and jumped on it. He 
sat down and unfolded his paper again. He didn't like to think about how 
foolish he had been. When he arrived at the place where he had first 
caught the bus that morning, he looked out eagerly to see the bus-stop 
seat. But no little fat pig was there ! Someone had untied him and he had 
wandered off. Mister Snooks spent a whole hour looking for him, and 
then went home, most annoyed with himself. 

8? 



THE PIG THAT WENT TO MARKET 




He set off again with his pig trotting quietly behind him. 

He went indoors and took off his things. When he went to put some- 
thing in the dust-bin he left the kitchen door open as usual and in a few 
minutes, the little pig, who had quietly trotted back to his garden, walked 
in. He sat himself down on the hearth-rug, and warmed himself by the 
fire. When Snooks went to take the kettle off the stove, he fell over 
Snorter, and bumped his nose on the fender. 

" Oh, so there you are ! " he said, sitting up and staring at Snorter. 
:< How many times have I ... oh well, never mind. I'm very glad you are 
back ! I shall take you to market to-morrow. Now, get out of my way, 
unless you want boiling water dripped on you ! ' 

Snorter knew Mister Snooks' carelessness with kettles, and he trotted 
under the table. Mister Snooks shooed him out into the garden, but in 
five minutes' time he was back again, oomphing quietly in front of the 
fire. He really was a most persistent little pig ! 

Next day Mister Snooks again put on his hat, coat and muffler, found 
a new bit of string and set off with the pig trotting quietly behind him. 

84 



THE PIG THAT WENT TO MARKET 

Snorter couldn't make up his mind what his master was thinking of doing, 
but imagined that he was just taking him for a walk, like a dog. He quite 
enjoyed it, for a change. 

This time Snooks didn't have to wait for the bus. It came rumbling 
up just as he got to the bus-stop. In he jumped, taking the surprised pig 
with him. 

" You can't have that pig here," said the conductor. " Passengers 
won't like it." 

' Well, could I put him outside by you? " asked Snooks. Snorter was 
sitting quietly on one of the seats, most astonished at everything. " I'll 
pay you a bit extra if you'll let him sit outside there, where you let people 
put their bags sometimes." 

" All right," said the conductor. So Snorter was trotted out by the 
conductor, and stowed away just under the stairs that led to the top of the 
bus. He sat there quietly beside two bags, and poked his nose out to see 
what was passing. 

Snooks paid fares for two, and then undid his newspaper. He had soon 
read it from cover to cover, and would have gone right past the market if the 
conductor hadn't bawled in his ear, and tapped him hard on the shoulder. 

" The Market, sir, the Market! " he cried. ' Didn't you say you 
wanted the market. Come out then, we can't wait here all day for you to 
get out! ' 

Mister Snooks jumped with fright to hear such a shouting in his ear. 
He pushed his newspaper into his pocket and rushed off the bus, nearly 
falling on his nose. Then, catching sight of Farmer Straw in the distance, 
he ran after him. 

" Hie, hie! " shouted the conductor. " What about your pig? ' 

Mister Snooks didn't even hear him, he was panting so much! He 
tore on, after Mister Straw. 

The conductor danced with rage on his bus, and yelled more loudly 
than ever. "Your pig, I say! You've left your pig, your PIG, PIG, 
PIG! " 

But Mister Snooks was too far away to hear a word. The conductor, 
thinking that the pig would follow Snooks to the market, undid the string 
and tipped him down the steps. The pig was astonished. This was a 
most surprising day. He had no idea where his master had gone, so he 

85 



THE PIG THAT WENT TO MARKET 

stood still, put his nose into the air and sniffed. His nose told him where 
his home was, so the little fellow started off down the dusty lanes, trotting 
merrily back to the garden he knew so well. 

Meanwhile Mister Snooks had caught up Farmer Straw. " Hey, 
there! " he panted. " Farmer Straw! Stop a moment. Do you still want 
to buy my pig? " 

The farmer stopped and turned round. He grinned when he saw 
Mister Snooks, all out of breath and red in the face. 

" Yes," he said. " I'll buy your pig, Snooks. Is he nice and fat? " 

" Oh, fine ! " said Snooks. " As fat as butter. He's the best pig in 
the world." 

" Where is he? " asked the farmer, looking about. 

Snooks looked round too. He was surprised to see no pig. He 
scratched his head, and frowned. Wherever could Snorter be? 

" Don't tell me you left him tied up to the bus-stop seat again! " cried 
the farmer, with a shout of laughter. " Oh, don't tell me that, Snooks! " 

" No, indeed I didn't," said Snooks. " I remember quite well taking 
him on the bus, because the conductor made a bit of a fuss about him. 
I had to put him outside by the bags there." 

" Well, where is he, then? " said Mister Straw. 

" I must have left him on the bus," said Mister Snooks, looking very 
blue. " Yes that's what happened. Oh dear me, how forgetful I am! ' 

" Well, look, there's the bus you came on, going back home again," 
said the farmer, pointing. " Catch it and get your pig ! Quick ! I'll wait 
here for you." 

Snooks ran to the bus and jumped on it. The conductor stared at him 
in surprise. 

" Where's my pig? " said Snooks. " Quick, tell me! I'm going to 
sell him." 

" Well, you won't sell him to-day! " said the conductor. " I shouted 
and shouted after you when I found you had left your pig here but you 
didn't take any notice, so I let him loose, thinking he'd come after you. 
Didn't he come? " 

" No, he didn't," said Snooks, gloomily. " Oh well, it's no good 
my going after Farmer Straw now, without my pig. He'll only laugh him- 
self purple in the face. I'd best go home. Here's my fare, conductor." 

86 



THE PIG THAT WENT TO MARKET 




The goose and the goat hurried after Mister Snooks. 

Snooks went home in the bus and let himself in at the front door. He 
had left the back door open as usual, but he had forgotten that. He went 
into the kitchen to set the kettle on the stove and dear me, bless us all, 
there, sitting on the hearth-rug as usual, was Snorter, the fat little pig! He 
had found his way home quite well, taking many a short cut on the way, 
and, finding the back door open, had gone in to sit by the fire. 

" Oh, so you're back again, are you ! " said Snooks, pleased. " That's 
good. I thought I'd lost you. Now get out of the kitchen, Snorter. 
Shoo! Shoo! " 

Out went Snorter, grunting " Ooooomph! Ooooomph! Ooooomph!" 

8? 



THE PIG THAT WENT TO MARKET 

But in two twinks he was back again, for, as usual, Snooks forgot to 
shut the kitchen door! 

Now the next day Snooks took up his hat, muffler and coat, and found 
a new piece of string to take the pig to market. He looked at himself 
sternly in the glass and said: " Now, Snooks, just be sensible to-day! 

" Remember to take the pig into the bus and remember to take him 
out of the bus ! Then maybe you'll get him to market and be able to sell 
him for a fine price to Farmer Straw! ' 

Then off he went, the pig trotting happily beside him on the string. 
Snorter was no longer' surprised at anything now. He just thought that 
his master must be quite mad, but he didn't mind at all. 

They got safely into the bus, and the conductor made the pig stand 
outside again. 

" Please don't let me get out of the bus without my pig this time," 
said Snooks to the conductor, when he paid his fare and the pig's. " I 
really must take him to market to-day." 

The conductor promised. The bus rattled on, and after some time 
the conductor bawled out " The Market, the Market! Remember your 
PIG, Mister Snooks, remember your PIG, PIG, PIG! " 

" All right, all right*" said Mister Snooks, going red when he saw 
everyone staring at him. ? You needn't keep on saying it. I'll remember 
the pig all right! " 

He got out of the bus and took the pig with him. Snorter jumped 
down and trotted along to the market beside his master, very much enjoy- 
ing saying " How do you do " to all the cows, goats, sheep, geese and 
ducks that he passed. 

Snooks looked everywhere for Mister Straw the farmer, but he 
couldn't see him. Someone told him that the farmer had gone to have a 
buttered bun in Dame Sally's cook-shop, so he went there. He tied up 
Snorter outside, and went in to find Farmer Straw. 

Snorter stood outside talking to a grey goose there and a fat goat. 
Both belonged to the same master, and their strings were tied together. 

:c My master wants to sell me," said the goose, and was just going to 
tell the pig all about her life when Mister Snooks came out of the cook- 
shop. Farmer Straw wasn't there. He had gone to sell two cows in the 
middle of the market at twelve o'clock. 



THE PIG THAT WENT TO MARKET 




He untied Snorter and ran off with him. 

Quickly, Mister Snooks untied the nearest string and set off to find 
the farmer but the foolish man had not looked to see that he was untying 
the right string and bless us all, he had the string belonging to the goose 
and the goat. Think of that ! The little pig was left behind and the goose 
and the goat hurried after Mister Snooks, wondering whatever in the 
world was happening. 

" SS-ss-ss-ss! " hissed the goose. But Mister Snooks took no notice. 
He was far too busy looking for Mister Straw. 

At last he spied the farmer, who had just sold his cows at a very good 
price indeed, and was looking very pleased with himself. 

" Farmer Straw! " called Mister Snooks, hurrying up to him. :f I've 
been looking for you all the morning. Will you buy my pig? ' 

" Certainly," said Mister Straw, jingling all the money in his pocket. 
:< I want a nice fat pig like yours, Mister Snooks. Where is he? ''' 

" I've got him on this string," said Mister Snooks. :e Come up, 
Snorter, come up! " 



THE PIG THAT WENT TO MARKET 

The farmer stared in astonishment at the goose and the goat on the 
string. Then he stared at Snooks. 

" Do you think you really have a pig to sell me? " he asked. " Or 
are you quite, quite mad? ' 

Snooks stared angrily at Mister Straw. Then he looked round to see 
his pig and he nearly fell backwards in amazement when he saw not one 
pig, but a goose and a goat, staring solemnly at him! 

" But there was a pig ! " he said. " There really was ! Oh dear what- 
ever can have happened to him this time ! ' 

Then Farmer Straw began to laugh till the tears ran down his big 
round nose. " Oh, Snooks, you'll be the death of me! " he cried. " You 
really will! You've gone and taken someone else's animals instead of your 
poor little pig. How you do lose that pig to be sure! Anyone would 
think you didn't want him ! ' 

Snooks stared at the goose and the goat, and his heart beat fast in dis- 
may. Yes he had left the pig behind at the cook-shop. He remembered 

seeing the goose and the goat out- 
side now. His pig must be there ! 

Off he went at top speed, the 
goose waddling behind him, hiss- 
ing and cackling and the goat trot- 
ting in surprise. They couldn't 
understand things at all. 

Back to the cook-shop went 
poor Mister Snooks and there, 
looking very lonely and forlorn out- 
side, was poor little Snorter the pig. 
He looked up at his master with sur- 
prised eyes when he saw him coming 
back with the goose and the goat. 

Snooks quietly tied up the two 
creatures hoping that no one had 
noticed the mistake he had made. But 
it was no use. Out of the shop came a 
furious little man, with bright red 
Sitting warming his nose by the kitchen fire, cheeks, angry eyes and a big Stick ! 




THE PIG THAT WENT TO MARKET 

:< So it was you who took my goose and my goat, was it? " he cried. 
" Take that, and take that! " 

Thwack, thwack ! Poor Mister Snooks got such sharp blows on his 
shoulders that he danced with pain. He almost ran away without his pig 
but he thought that really he couldn't go without him again. So he quickly 
untied Snorter and ran off with him, his shoulders smarting with the blows 
that the furious little man kept giving him. 

" My! " thought Mister Snooks. " This is the last time I am so for- 
getful. It doesn't pay! It leads to no end of trouble ! Oh dear! Now I 
must find Mister Straw." 

He hunted about for the farmer for two hours and couldn't find him 
anywhere. Lots of people told him where they had just seen him, but when 
Mister Snooks arrived there, hot and bothered, he had always just gone. 

But at last Snooks found him. He was about to get into his farm-cart, 
ready to drive home. 

" Hie, hie ! " shouted Snooks, running up. " Wait a moment. Will 
you buy my pig? I really have got him this time! ' 

He went up to Mister Straw, and the farmer looked down at the pig. 
" Ah," he said. " That surely is a fine pig, one of the fattest I've ever seen! 
A fine little fellow, surely ! ' 

" How much will you give me for him? " asked Mister Snooks, 
eagerly. 

" Nothing ! " said the farmer. " You look into my cart, Snooks, and 
tell me what you see there." Snooks looked and in the bottom of the 
cart lay what do you think a fine fat little pig, with a very curly tail 
and very bright eyes ! " I've just bought him ! " said the farmer, whipping 
up his horse and starting off home. " Sorry, Mister Snooks you're just 
too late. It was a pity you kept forgetting to take that pig of yours to 
market! I'd take him home and keep him if I were you! ' 

So away back home went poor Mister Snooks with Snorter the pig. 
He didn't try to take him to market to sell him any more. No he decided 
that it was too hard work to keep losing him and finding him again. So 
now he goes out to work and earns quite a lot of money. 

As for Snorter the pig, you can guess where be is! Sitting warming 
his nose by the kitchen fire for, as you may know by now, Snooks never 
can remember to shut his kitchen door!

The Funny Old Dragon 

ONE wintry morning James had the biggest surprise of his life! He was 
going across the field-path on a misty day when he heard something 
snorting in the field over the hedge. 

" I wonder what it is," he said, and he peeped to see. And, good 
gracious me, in the next field was a dragon ! Yes, a dragon, just like you 
see in a story-book, with a long spiky tail and four clawed feet! 

James was so astonished that he stared and stared and stared. The 
dragon saw him and nodded to him. 

:< Good-day," he said, in a mournful voice. " Fm looking for work. 
Can you tell me of any? " 

" Well," said James, still more surprised to hear the dragon's strange, 
husky voice. " I'm afraid I don't know of any work a dragon can do. How 
did you come here? I didn't know there were any dragons at all nowadays." 

" There shouldn't be, really," said the dragon. " But somehow I 
grew, though I know I'm dreadfully out of date and useless. Nobody 
wants a dragon nowadays, not even to fight with. So I left the place where 
I lived and came out to look for work. I'm very unhappy, really." 

James squeezed through the hedge. He was sorry for the dragon, 
who had very large, soft brown eyes. He took a good look at him. 

" Well, I should think you'd better keep yourself hidden," he said. 
' ( It's not likely anyone would be frightened of you nowadays, but you 
might be caught and put into the Zoo in a great big cage, like the lions 
and tigers and bears and you might not like that! ' 

92 



THE FUNNY OLD DRAGON 

: ' Oh no, I shouldn't! " said the dragon in alarm. " Couldn't you 
take me home with you and let me be your pet? I've a very sweet, loving 
nature, really." 

' No, I don't think my mother would like a dragon on the rug in 
front of the fire," said James. " In fact, I'm sure she wouldn't. And 
Daddy would say you smelt." 

" Smelt! " said the dragon, offended. " Do I smell? What do I 
smell of? " 

1 You smell of smoke," said James, sniffing. 

:< Ah, that's because I can breathe out fire and smoke just like the old 
dragons could in the fairy-tales! " said the dragon. " Watch! " 

James watched. The dragon breathed out a lot of smoke from his 
nose and mouth, and a long red flame spurted out too. The dragon looked 
proudly at James. 

" What do you think of that ? " he said. " A good trick, isn't it? " 

r * My goodness ! " said James, " you'd be useful to Daddy when he 
lights bonfires! A puff of your flame and smoke and any bonfire would go 
well! I wish I could do that! " 

:< Listen, boy ! " said the dragon excitedly. " Couldn't I help with 
people's bonfires? I could hide in a chimney in the daytime somewhere, 
and then my breath coming out at the top would look like chimney smoke 
but at night I could creep out and go all round puffing at people's bon- 
fires and making them burn well. I should love that. That would be a 
real good piece of work for me to do ! ' 

" Well, if I let you do that, will you teach me how to breathe out fire 
and smoke just like you do? " asked James longingly. 

" Of course ! " said the dragon. So they shook hands solemnly, and 
James managed to take the dragon to his house by the side-door, get him 
into the study, and stuff him up the chimney without anyone seeing. 

The dragon was long, but not fat, so he was quite all right in the 
chimney. His breath shot out at the top, and no one thought it was any- 
thing else but ordinary chimney smoke. 

That night James gave him a tug and he slid neatly down and slipped 
out into the garden. He went to the bonfire that James's Daddy had tried 
to light. There had been a shower of rain and the bonfire was almost out. 

" Puff! Fffffffff! Puff!" went the dragon busily, blowing out smoke 

93 



THE FUNNY OLD DRAGON 




" Puff I " went the dragon, blowing out smoke and flames. The bonfire flared up. 

and flames. The bonfire flared up at once and the rubbish began to burn 
merrily. The dragon laughed and so did James. This was fun! 

" Where's the next bonfire? " asked the dragon. " I don't feel useless 
and out of date any more, James. I am enjoying myself! ' 

Well, the old dragon got everybody's bonfire burning very well 
indeed, and James knew that all the gardeners and Daddies would be 
simply delighted the next day. And he would be the only one that knew 
the secret! James felt rather grand. 

" Teach me how to breathe fire and smoke, please, dragon," he said. 
c You promised you would." So the dragon gave him his first lesson. MY 
goodness, it was most exciting, I can tell you ! James was able to breathe 
out just a little bit of blue smoke at the end of his first lesson. 

" Hoo! " said James, " won't I make the boys stare at school! My 
word, no one will dare to be rude to me or punch me when I can breathe 
out fire and smoke! I shall have fun! ' 

94 



THE FUNNY OLD DRAGON 

The dragon went back to his chimney after that and James crept into 
bed. Every night they went out together, and soon they were very fond of 
one another indeed. The dragon was the kindest-hearted creature, very 
fond of a joke, and James did wish he could build him a large kennel 
and have him for a pet. But somehow he felt sure people wouldn't like 
it. 

" I'm very happy now," the dragon told James. " I have good work 
to do and I have a friend. That is all I want. Be sure to let me know, 
dear James, whenever any of your friends want their bonfires kept 
burning in the night, and you may be sure I will go and do what I can 
for them." 

So if your Daddy can't get his bonfire to burn well, send me a card 
for James, and I'm sure he'll arrange things for you. And if you meet 
a boy who can breathe fire and smoke out of his mouth and nose, you'll 
know who he is it will be James, the only boy in the kingdom who keeps 
a dragon up the chimney!

rHEN I was a little girl I furnished my 
doll's house with chestnut furniture. If 
you are a little girl, you can do the same. If you 
are a boy, you can make the furniture for your 
sister. 

You want nice big flattish conkers, long pins, and some wool. Now, 
are you ready? 

Make a stool first. How easy ! Just a flat conker, with three pins stuck 
underneath but it stands quite well! We don't need the wool for that, 
unless you like to twist wool round each leg to make them look nice. 

Now for a chair. We will have another flat conker, and stick in four 
pins for legs, and three at the back. Now the wool comes in. Wind it in 
and out of the three pins to make a pretty back to the chair. 

Now we will make a " wicker " chair. Put in the pins as before, but 
wind the wool round the four legs as well. That makes a very fine 
" wicker " chair indeed. You will have to twist the wool round each leg 
as well as passing it round the four of them, or it will slip up and down 
too much. 

Can you make an arm-chair? Think it out yourself! You just want 
shorter pins for the arms, don't you? See what nice ones you can make.

HOUSE TH4T KMT HIS WHISKERS 



THERE was once a most inquisitive little mouse called Woffles. He 
poked his sharp nose into everything, and knew everyone's business. 
He had a long thin tail, and the finest whiskers of his family. They spread 
out on each side of his face and gave him a very knowing look indeed. 

Woffles was proud of his whiskers. He twitched them about when 
he spoke, and everyone noticed them and said: " Oh, Woffles, how fine 
your whiskers are! ' Then he felt pleased. 

One night Woffles looked out of his window and saw a bright light in 
the garden next door. Mr. Tailer, a large vole, lived there. Woffles won- 
dered what he could be doing in the garden so late at night, and he felt 
very curious. He really must go and see ! 

Mr. Tailer was simply lighting a bonfire to burn his rubbish, that was 
all. He had turned out a lot of old boxes and papers and he wanted to burn 
them. The bonfire wouldn't light properly, for it had been raining and the 
pile of rubbish was wet so Mr. Tailer went indoors to get some paraffin to 
throw on the heap. Then it would flare up and soon burn away. 

Woffles crept out of his back door, climbed over the fence and ran to 
the rubbish-heap, where he could see a little flame trying to lick up the 
rubbish. 

"I wonder what old Mr. Tailer is burning!" thought Woffles to 
himself. " Perhaps there is a box here that would do to keep my 
firewood in." 

97 




He looked at himself in the glass. 



THE MOUSE THAT LOST HIS WHISKERS 

He began to scrape about 
busily in the pile, and he didn't 
hear Mr. Tailer coming back with 
a tin of paraffin. Mr. Tailer threw 
some paraffin on the heap, the little 
flame caught it and it all flared up 
in a rush, startling Woffles almost 
out of his wits ! 

He rushed off, jumped over 
the fence and ran indoors, very 
much frightened. And then he had 
another dreadful shock for when he looked at himself in the glass, oh 
dear me! His beautiful long whiskers had all been burnt off when the fire 
flamed up ! Woffles stared at himself in horror. 

" My whiskers! "Jie said, in a frightened whisper. " My beautiful, 
beautiful whiskers! They are gone! Oh, how dreadful I look! Oh, what 
will people say! How they will laugh at me! Oh, why did I poke my 
nose into old Tatter's rubbish-heap? What a terrible thing to happen 
to me! " 

Poor Woffles didn't sleep that night. He tossed and turned in his 
small bed and wondered what to do. At last he made up his mind that he 
would tie up his face in a handkerchief, to hide that he had lost his whiskers, 
and then he would see if he couldn't get some from somebody. Perhaps 
Dame Longnose could get him some. She was very clever indeed. 

So the next day everyone was most astonished to see Woffles with his 
face tied up in a handkerchief. They felt sure he had the tooth-ache and 
they were very sorry for him. 

" Poor Woffles ! " said Mrs. Rabbit. " Come along to my burrow 
to-night when my husband is at home. He will pull out any tooth that is 
aching." 

" Oh, no thank you! " said Woffles, and ran off in a hurry. He didn't 
want people to start pulling his teeth out! It was quite bad enough to have 
lost his whiskers without losing his teeth too ! 

He thought he would go and visit Dame Longnose. So he packed up 
a bag and off he went. That night he arrived at the Dame's cottage and she 
let him in, surprised to see the little mouse so late at night. 



THE MOUSE THAT LOST HIS WHISKERS 

:< Dame Longnose, I've lost my whiskers," said Woffles. " Could 
you get me some new ones ? " 

" I might take a few from my cat," said Dame Longnose. " But you'll 
have to work for me for a week if you want new whiskers." 

" Very well," said Woffles, with a sigh. He felt sure that Dame Long- 
nose would work him very hard indeed. And she did\ He had to be up 
early every morning and light the fire. Then he had to clean the cottage, 
and when that was done he had to go and chop firewood for an hour. All 
the time he tried to keep out of the way of the old dame's cat, who lay 
dozing in a warm basket by the fire. Luckily for Woffles the dame fed her 
cat very well indeed and he was not very much interested in mice. 

One night, when Woffles was sleeping peacefully under the mangle in 
the scullery, he heard the cat hissing and spitting at Dame Longnose. Then 
he heard a smack, and then more hissing and spitting. He trembled and 
wondered what the matter was. 

It was the old dame asking her cat for some of his fine whiskers for 

Woffles the mouse. Woffles had 
done a week's work and the witch 
meant to pay him the next day by 
giving him six of her cat's big 
white whiskers. But the cat was 
angry about it and hissed and spat 
whenever the old dame cut one off 
though he could well spare a few 
for he had a most magnificent set 
of whiskers, really far too thick. 

The old woman took the six 
whiskers and put them into a box, 
ready for the morning. Then she 
went to her bed, lay down, and 
soon began to snore. The cat felt 
very angry. 

" To think that my fine whis- 
kers should go to a miserable little 
mouse! " he raged, as he walked 
up and down the kitchen like a

The old woman took six whiskers. 



THE MOUSE THAT LOST HIS WHISKERS 

tiger. "I won't have it! No, I won't! Where is that mouse? I'll go 
and tell him what I think of him! ' 

He went into the scullery and smelt the mouse under the mangle. He 
put a paw there and tried to get the frightened mouse out. " Oho ! So it's 
you that my mistress has taken my whiskers for ! " hissed the cat. " You 
nasty, creeping little creature! How dare you come here and ask for my 
whiskers? ' 

" I d-d-d-didn't," said the mouse, trembling. " Dame Longnose 
offered them to me for a week's work." 

" Well, as soon as I see you wearing my whiskers, I shall eat you up," 
said the cat, fiercely. " I shall get my whiskers back that way! Ho ho! 
What a joke! All right, mouse, you may wear my whiskers to-morrow 
but remember I shall have you for my dinner, as sure as I can lap milk ! " 

With that the cat went back to the kitchen, feeling pleased with him- 
self. As for Woffles he was in a terrible way. He wanted those whiskers 
but he didn't want to be the cat's dinner ! Oh no, that would be dreadful. 

" I'd better run away whilst I've got the chance," thought poor 
Woffles. " I daren't stay here now. The cat is so angry because I'm to have 
some of his whiskers. Well, I must just go without them, that's all ! " 

He waited until he thought the cat was fast asleep, then he went to the 
door, slipped under it and ran for his life. His face was still tied up in his 
handkerchief, for he had not untied it all the week. He still felt so ashamed 
of not having any whiskers. 

He took his little bag with him, but he didn't want to go home. People 
would be so surprised to see him with his face still tied up. He hid in a 
ditch until the morning came and then he set out on his way again. 
Presently he met a hedgehog, who shouted good morning to him. 

" Where are you going? " he asked. 

" I want to buy some new whiskers somewhere," said Woffles. " Do 
you know where I can get some ? ' : 

" Well, why not try a toy-shop? " said the prickly hedgehog. " You 
know, toy rabbits, cats and dogs all have whiskers, so I daresay if you went 
to a toy-shop you could get some fine ones there quite cheaply." 

" Oh thank you! That's a splendid idea! " said Woffles gratefully, 
wondering why he hadn't thought of it before. He hurried on until he 
came to a small village and then he looked for a toy-shop. He found one

inside. The doorbell 
queer little gnome 




and went 

rang and a 

popped up above the counter. 

" What do you want? " he 
asked. 

" Have you any whiskers for 
sale? " asked Woffles. " I've lost 
mine and I want some new ones." 

" Certainly! " said the gnome, 
and he took down a box from a 
shelf. " Come and look! I've all 
kinds, all colours and all lengths ! " 

Woffles was delighted. He sat 
on a chair by the counter and 
looked eagerly at the box. What 
wonderful whiskers there were 
there ! Long stiff black ones, bright 
red ones, small soft white ones, 
deep blue ones oh, every kind 
you can imagine ! 

" How much are they? " asked Woffles, feeling for his small purse. 

:< Sixpence a set " said the gnome. 

:< Oh dear! How expensive! " sighed Woffles, who only had six 
pennies in his purse, and didn't want to part with all his money at once. 
' Well, I suppose I must have a set. Here is the money." 

He put his six brown pennies down on the counter and the gnome 
took them at once. " Which set of whiskers will you have? " he asked. 

" I think I think I'll have those nice long, bright red ones ! " said 
Woffles, thinking how grand he would look with such bright whiskers. 
The gnome took them out of the box and put them on the counter. Then 
he put away the box and took down from another shelf a round work- 
basket. He took up a big darning needle and threaded one of the whiskers 
through the eye-hole. Woffles looked at him in alarm. 

" What is the needle for? " he asked. 

" To sew on your whiskers, of course! " said the gnome, impatiently. 
" What do you think? I always sew on these whiskers for my customers. 

101 



I want to buy some new whiskers." 



THE MOUSE THAT LOST HIS WHISKERS 







He sat oo a stool by the counter and looked eagerly at the box. 



They can't do it themselves. I sewed on two sets yesterday one on a toy 
cat and the other set on a velvet lion. They looked fine, I can tell you! 
Now, take off that handkerchief you've got wound round your head, and 
IT! just sew these whiskers on neatly for you." 

" B-b-b-b-but it will hurt m-m-m-me ! " said Woffles, in a fright. 
" Can't you stick them on! ' 

" No good at all," said the gnome. " Stuck-on whiskers always come 
oft Sewing is the only thing for whiskers. Please hurry up and take off 
that handkerchief. I'm busy to-day! ' 

** No," said Woffles, firmly. " No. I'm not going to have that great 
needle sticking into me, sewing on those whiskers. Give me back my 
money, please. I won't buy whiskers that have to be sewn on." 

'You certainly won't have your money back! " said the gnome 
crossly. * What, after all the trouble I've taken, you say you're not going 
to have those lovely whiskers. I never heard of such a thing ! Come along 
now I'm ready to sew on the whiskers at once! ' 

He suddenly came round the counter and made a dash at Woffles. 

102 




He ran until he had no breath left. 



THE MOUSE THAT LOST HIS WHISKERS 

The mouse was frightened and 
jumped off the stool at once. When 
he saw the big needle shining in 
the gnome's horny hand he gave a 
shriek and fled out of the door. He 
ran until he had no breath left and 
then he hid himself under a bush. 

:< I've left all my six pennies 
behind! " he wept. "And I've 
still got no whiskers. Oh, what an 
unfortunate creature I am!" 

Someone passing by heard him crying and stopped to peep under 
the bush. It was an old witch. She had kindly eyes and a smiling 
mouth, for she was a good witch. She was sorry to see such a heart- 
broken little mouse. 

Woffles told her all his troubles. She listened very kindly, and then 
she patted his small head. 

:< Come home with me and help me with my spells for two weeks," 
she said. * Then I will make you some fine whiskers and put them on by 
magic so that they won't hurt a bit." 

Woffles was delighted. He went happily home with the witch and 
was soon busily helping her with her spells. How he worked ! He chanted 
magic songs. He stood inside hundreds of magic chalk circles whilst the 
witch made spells. He stirred magic potions until his paws ached and felt 
as if they would drop off. He hunted for magic herbs from morning till 
night and grew quite thin with all his hard work. 

When the end of the two weeks came the witch smiled at him. " You 
have done well, Woffles," she said. " Now I will make your new whiskers 
for you. Come and see me." 

Woffles watched her. First she poured a little moonlight into a cup. 
Then she took a peacock's feather and cut tiny pieces off it. She put them 
into the cup too. Then she asked a spider to spin webs across the cup. 
After that she turned the whole thing upside down, chanted a few queer 
magic words and turned the cup the right way up. The web, the moon- 
light and the bits of feather were all gone. Inside the cup was a set of 
wonderful blue whiskers, just the right size for Woffles! 

103 



THE MOUSE THAT LOST HIS WHISKERS 

" Take off your handkerchief and let me put them on for you," said 
the witch. " It won't hurt a bit." 

Joyfully Woffles unwound his handkerchief and turned his little 
brown face to the witch. She stared at him. Then she stared even harder. 
Then she began to laugh. Woffles couldn't understand it. What was the 
joke? 

" Oh Woffles ! " said the witch. " You don't want any whiskers after 
all! Go and look at yourself in the glass." 

He ran to the glass on the wall and peered in and to his great 
astonishment he saw that he had a very fine set of whiskers indeed just 
like his old ones ! He stared and stared where had they come from? 




Then she took a peacock's feather. 
104 



THE MOUSE THAT LOST HIS WHISKERS 

" Oh Woffles, you silly little mouse, your burnt-ofF whiskers have 
grown again! " said the witch and she laughed till she cried. " To think 
you've worked for a week for old Dame Longnose, and given that toy- 
shop gnome six pennies, and worked for me for a fortnight for new 
whiskers and all the time you didn't need them because you had a lovely 
new set growing under your handkerchief. Ho ho ho! ' 

Woffles was glad, and yet he was sorry. What a lot of work he had 
done for nothing! How people would laugh when they heard about his 
whiskers! What a foolish fellow he had been! 

" It's no use my giving you these whiskers now," said the witch, 
throwing them into the fire. :< But let me give you a piece of advice 
instead, Woffles. Don't go poking that sharp little nose of yours into other 
people's business! Then your fine new whiskers will be safe! ' 

" Thank you," said Woffles, humbly, and he ran off home with his 
bag. Everyone was delighted to see him again but he didn't say a word 
about his adventures. No he was much too ashamed of himself. 

" I'll keep my nose to myself in future! " he said to himself and, 
as he has still got his very fine whiskers, I expect he has kept his word!

Tig, the Brownie Robber 

THERE was once a robber brownie called Tig. He was big and fat and 
vain, and he had twenty servant brownies who followed him every- 
where. Tig was a rogue. He and his twenty little servants would creep up 
to a village in the night, surround it, and then, with loud shouts and yells, 
frighten all the people so that they came rushing out of their homes. Then 
the brownies would run into the open doors and steal anything they could 
lay their hands on. 

Everybody was afraid of them. 

One of the servants always carried a large trunk, full of Tig's beautiful 
coats. Tig wore all kinds of colours, and his coats were sewn with silver 
and gold, and set with precious stones. He was very proud of them indeed. 

Now one day, as Tig and his servants passed quietly through a wood 
on their way to a village they meant to surprise that night, they were seen 
by a small pixie whose name was Shrimpy, because he was so little. He 
heard the sound of quiet tramping, and looked out of the hole of the tree 
in which he was living. How excited he was to see the robbers ! 

" If anyone catches those robbers they get a sack of gold ! " thought 
Shrimpy with joy. " Now, I am a clever pixie. Maybe if I follow the 
robbers I shall learn their ways and find some way of catching them 
all!" 

So he jumped out of his tree and began to follow the robbers. But he 
hadn't gone very far, creeping behind trees and watching them, before Tig 
caught sight of him. Tig had very sharp eyes in his round fat face, and 
they didn't miss anything. 

106 



TIG, THE BROWNIE ROBBER 

" Oho ! " he said in a large voice. " Catch that pixie, servants. He is 
following us! ' 

And in a trice Shrimpy was caught and taken before the robber thief. 
" What shall we do with him? " said one of the servants. " Shall we 
throw him into the lake? '' 

" Or tie him to the topmost branch of a tree? " said another. 
Shrimpy didn't like the sound of this at all. " Please let me join your 
band," he said, thinking that he could easily escape at any time. " I will 
do any work you like." 

" Ho ho! " laughed Tig. " What! A shrimp like you do work for 
us! What work could you do? ' 

" I am very strong," said Shrimpy. 

" Well, if he's so strong, let him carry your trunk of coats, Master! ' 
said the brownie whose job it was to carry the trunk on his shoulder all 
day. He was getting very tired of it. 

" Very well," said Tig, with a big grin all over his fat face. " You 
shall join our band, and carry my trunk, Shrimpy." 

So poor Shrimpy had to put 
the heavy trunk on his small shoul- 
der and carry it about all that day. 
Dear me, it was heavy! He didn't 
like it at all, and he wished he hadn't 
tried to interfere with the robbers. 
" Never mind," thought 
Shrimpy, his quick little brain 
working hard. " Maybe I can find 
some way to catch the robbers yet. 
Oh, if only I could! " 

It was cold weather. In the 
daytime the brownies were warm, 
but at night they shivered and 
shook. Tig was all right because 
he just put on a few of his extra 
coats, and was as warm as toast. 
But the servants had no extra coats, 
and they felt very cold indeed. 




And in a trice Shrimpy was caught. 



I0 7 



That night was really freezing. Tig gave orders that his servants were 
to camp under the trees, and he would march on a little way ahead to a 
cottage he knew. A friend of his lived there, and he meant to have supper 
with him. 

" I'll be back in the morning," he told his men. " Shrimpy, you come 
with me. I may want to change my coat to-night, when I see my friend, 
so you must carry my trunk. And if there is any message to give my men, 
you shall go back with it." 

Shrimpy groaned. Oh dear! He had so hoped that he could find a 
hole in a tree and sleep there, warm and comfortable that night. Now he 
had to carry that horrid trunk through the wood for miles! 

He put it on his shoulder and followed Tig. How glad he was when 
the master brownie came to the cottage and was welcomed by his 
friend! 

" I shan't want any of my coats after all," said Tig, with a grin. " I 
knew I shouldn't. But I thought it would do you good to carry that trunk 
a bit longer! ' 

And with that the unkind brownie slammed the door and left Shrimpy 
outside with the trunk. 

" All that way to go back with this hateful trunk ! " groaned poor 
Shrimpy. <:< Oh, it's too bad ! I could have been resting all this long time. 
How I hate Tig! " 

He put the trunk on his shoulder and staggered back through the 
wood with it, thinking how horrid Tig was, and how he wished he could 
punish him. And slowly a plan came into his quick little mind. 

He was so pleased with it that he almost danced for joy, though the 
trunk felt heavier than ever. At last he got back to the camp. He called 
to the men. 

' There is a message from the master ! ' 

" What is it? " cried the men, gathering round him, shivering, for 
their fire did not give out much heat. 

' You are to warm yourselves by digging a big pit to-night," said 
Shrimpy. " It is to be a trap for an enemy, and must be finished quickly, 
before the daylight comes. If it is finished well, Tig says you may each have 
a coat of his to keep you warm to-night. I will button them round you. 
Now, work hard! ' 

108 



TIG, THE BROWNIE ROBBER 

Grumbling loudly the tired servants took spades from out their bags and 
began to dig a big pit. When it was finished they were certainly very warm. 
Shrimpy was busy whilst they were digging. He was unpacking the trunk. 

Inside there were a great many coats, all made very large indeed to fit 
Tig, who really was an enormous brownie. Shrimpy got each one out, and 
felt his way to young trees that stood here and there in the wood. He care- 
fully put a coat round each slender tree, but did not button it up. 

" Is the pit finished? " he asked at last. " Good! Now, I have taken 
the coats out and got them ready for you to put on. You had better put 
them on back to front and then the cold wind will not blow down your 
chests. You can have your backs against a tree." 

He took the first brownie and led him to a tree round which he had 
put one of Tig's big coats. He made the servant slip his arms into the 
sleeves back to front and then, very quickly, Shrimpy buttoned the coat 
up tightly down the back round the tree-trunk ! And there was the ser- 
vant buttoned to the tree so that he couldn't possibly get away, for he 
could not reach to undo the buttons! 




One by one Shrimpy buttoned up the tired brownies. 

109 



TIG, THE BROWNIE ROBBER 

One by one Shrimpy buttoned up the tired brownies. It was dark, so 
they did not see what Shrimpy was doing. One or two of them grumbled 
because the tree felt so hard and uncomfortable at their back but they 
were so very tired that they fell asleep even though they were so uncom- 
fortable. 

Shrimpy was simply delighted. He had fastened all the servants to the 
trees ! They couldn't undo the coats ! They could only yell for help and 
that was just what he wanted them to do! Aha! Wait for the morning, 
Tig, and see what happens to you! 

As soon as daylight came creeping through the trees, little Shrimpy 
ran to the pit that the servants had dug the night before. It was very deep, 
and the sides were very straight. Shrimpy gathered armfuls of bracken and 
pulled sticks and twigs from the bushes. He strewed them over the pit 
opening so that it could not be seen. 

Then he hid himself in a hole of a tree and waited to see what would 
happen. 

As soon as the servants awoke they tried to free themselves from the 
trees they were buttoned to but they could not. They struggled and 
shouted, they tried to reach the buttons at the back of the tree, but it was 
no use at all. The coats were strong and big, and held them prisoner. 

Shrimpy looked out of his tree and giggled. The servants saw him 
and shouted at him angrily; 

" Come and set us free ! Come and unbutton us ! " 

But Shrimpy laughed and shook his head. 

" You wait till Tig comes ! " roared the angry brownies. " He will 
untie us, and catch you and punish you! This is a very silly trick to 
play!" 

Just then Shrimpy heard Tig coming along singing loudly. 
" Here comes robber brownie Tig, 

Fat and plump and round and big! ' 
sang Tig, very pleased after his good warm night and fine hot breakfast. 

" Master! Master! Help us! " yelled his servants. " Shrimpy has 
buttoned us to the trees in your coats and we can't get away! ' 

Tig stopped singing and glared through the trees. He could just see 
his servants there, neatly buttoned up to the trunks ! He gave a roar and 
rushed towards them. 

no 



TIG, THE BROWNIE ROBBER 

Shrimpy appeared round the 
trunk of a tree and grinned at him. 
" You wicked little thing! " cried 
Tig, and tore after Shrimpy. 
Shrimpy ran to where the pit was 
hidden beneath bracken and twigs. 
He leapt lightly over it, but Tig 
did not know the pit was there, 
and he fell heavily into it plonk! 

He roared again and got up. 
But the pit was so deep and steep 
that he couldn't get out! There he 
was, caught in the hole his servants 
had dug and there were his ser- 
vants, crying and howling because 
their master had disappeared into 
the pit and couldn't rescue them! 

Shrimpy laughed with joy 
"You wicked little thine," cried Tig. i , * ,? 3 * 

and then set off to the nearest 

town. Very soon he was back with fifty pixies, fairies, and elves. How they 
laughed to see the twenty brownies buttoned up in big coats to tree- 
trunks, and Tig stamping round the deep pit, trying in vain to get out! 

" You are the cleverest little pixie in the world ! " they said to 
Shrimpy, as they unbuttoned each brownie and tied him up with rope. 
" You shall have a sack of gold for your clever night's work! " 

He did and with it he bought himself a large toadstool, with three 
windows in the top and a door in the stem. He bought himself cobweb 
curtains from the big spider under the hedge, and got the fairy carpenter 
to make him some lovely furniture. 

" I shan't have to live in a hole in a tree any more!" he said joyfully. 
" I am very grand now. I shall get a wife as small as myself, and we will 
live in our toadstool house together and have a fine time! ' 

As for Tig and the brownies, they were sent off to the moon for one 
hundred years, so they won't worry anyone for a long, long time!

Stars for the Christmas Tree 



WOULD you like to make some five-pointed stars to hang on the 
Christmas Tree, or to decorate the nursery or school room? I'll 
tell you how to do it. 

You will have to look very carefully indeed at the pictures. Fold a 
piece of coloured paper in half, as in Picture i . Use coloured paper if you 
can. Silver or gold paper will make lovely stars if you can get some. 

Now fold the paper as I have drawn for you in Picture 2. Can you 
manage that? Do you see the bit I have marked with a little star? You 
must now fold that bit backwards, so that your paper looks like Picture 3. 
Done that? Good ! Now fold the right-hand piece back, so that you get 
the shape in Picture 4. Notice the two points at the top. They will help 
you to see that you have the right shape. 

Now for the five-pointed star! Get your scissors. Cut across your 
paper where I have drawn the dotted line (Picture 5). Your paper is now 
in half. Take the bottom half and unfold it and there is your silver or gold 
five-pointed star (Picture 6). Isn't it pretty? 

If you can't fold the paper right at first, go on trying. You'll get the 
star in the end.

Answer on page 224. 




113 




ONCE upon a time there were some naughty little goblins. They were 
always on the look-out for anything they could take home to use for 
themselves buns off a window-sill, left there to cool, somebody's washing 
left on the line at night, a parcel dropped off a van. Ah, they were wicked 
little creatures, there was no doubt about that! 

But one day they got hold of something that taught them a lesson ! 
Just listen. 

They were walking home one night when they came to the shed 
belonging to three boys Tom, John, and Peter. It was their play- 
shed, and in it they kept their tools, their barrows, and other odds and 
ends. And, as Guy Fawkes' Day was coming, they kept their fire- 
works there as well. 

They had a fine lot of fireworks! They had been saving their 
money for weeks, and as they bought their fireworks they put them 
into a big bag. There it was, hanging on a nail, getting nice and full. 
"There are rockets!" said Tom. 

"And Catherine-wheels ! ' ' 
said John. 

" And Golden Rain, and 
Roman Candles, and jumping 
squibs, and whizz-bangs!" said 
Peter. " Oooh! What a time we'll 
have!" 

Well, so they would have had 
a grand time, if those naughty gob- 
lins hadn't come walking by and 
poked their noses into the shed! 

114 




Footprints in the mud. 




Emptied all the fireworks onto the flames. 



One of them, Snooky, saw the bag 
hanging up on a nail, and he ran 
to get it. 

" It may be foil of gold! "he 
whispered to the others. They set 
off down the road in glee. But they 
didn't notice that the bag had a 
hole in the bottom, and out of that 
hole dropped some of the smallest 
fireworks ! 

It was the hole in the bag that 
helped Tom, Peter and John to 

follow the little thieves. They arrived at the shed one evening after tea 
just after the goblins had gone and found their bag of fireworks stolen! 
Oh dear! 

" Who's taken it! " cried Tom angrily. He went to the door and 
looked about. The moon was up but he could see nobody about the roads. 

" Look! " said John suddenly, pointing to a little squib lying in the 
road. " Whoever took the bag went that way, for there's a squib that must 
have fallen out of it! ' 

" Yes the bag had a hole in it! " cried Peter. " Let's see if any more 
fireworks are down the road." 

They went down the moonlit road and, sure enough, here and there 
they found a firework that had slipped out of the hole in the bag. Then 
they came to a very muddy bit of lane, and the three boys stood there looking 
puzzled, for the footprints in the mud were not at all like theirs ! 

" These footmarks are of queer little pointed feet! " said Peter. " I 
believe it's goblins or brownies who have taken our fireworks ! ' 

" Come on, after them then! " cried the others; so on they went at 
top speed, keeping a good look-out for the fallen fireworks. 

Well, very soon the goblins heard the three boys coming after them. 
They looked round in alarm. The boys seemed very big indeed to the tiny 
creatures, and the goblins were frightened. 

" Hi, stop, you little robbers ! " cried Tom, in a loud and angry voice. 

" What shall we do what shall we do? " said the goblins to one 
another. " They will catch us with the bag if we go on." 



THE FIREWORK GOBLINS 

" Look, there's a bonfire over there ! Let's empty the bag on to it, and 
let everything burn to bits," said Snooky. " Then the boys won't be able to 
find out that we've taken it! ' 

So the silly little creatures ran to the bonfire, and emptied all the fire- 
works on to the flames. They stuffed the bag deep into the heart of the 
bonfire and it began to burn away. 

The three boys ran up angrily. " Where's our bag of fireworks? " 
cried John. 

" Yes, what have you done with it? " cried Peter. 

" What bag? What fireworks? " asked the goblins pretending to be 
very much astonished. " We don't know anything about fireworks? ' : 

But they soon did for the fire got hold of those fireworks one by 
one, and exploded them with loud pops and bangs! 

" BANG! " said a rocket, and flew up into the air with a whizz! It 
exploded into red and green stars, and the goblins shrieked in fright. 

" What is it? Oh, what is it? " 

The boys began to laugh. ' You silly goblins, you've thrown the 
fireworks on to the fire they'll all explode! You'd better look out! " 

The goblins clung together, hardly daring to move. A jumping squib 
went off with a bang and sprang right out of the fire ! Whizz ! 

" OW! " yelled Snooky, for it landed on his toe. " Get away! " The 
squib jumped to the next goblin, and then to the next. How those goblins 
howled ! They had never in their lives seen fireworks before and they didn't 
at all know what they were. The three boys laughed till the tears ran 
down their cheeks. 




?< 

The boys began to laugh. 

116 




THE FIREWORK GOBLINS 

\ .-~ZZS&e^^ ~>*A "? AN ? ! " A'whfefr.bang 

went oft with a loud clap, and the 
goblins jumped high into the air. 
Then a Catherine-wheel got alight, 
jumped out of the fire, and tried to 
whizz round on Snooky 's foot. Oh 
dear ! oh dear ! Snooky ran to the 
other side of the bonfire. But here 
a rocket was waiting for him and 

It caught hold of Snooky and took him shot out. It caught hold of Snooky 
into the air. i i i_ i , 

and took him up into the air! 

" Let me go! let me go!" yelled Snooky, holding on for all he 
was worth. A shower of bright stars shot out round him, and then the 
empty rocket-case fell to the ground again, taking Snooky with it. 
Bump! 

" Ooooooh! " said Snooky, when he got his breath back. " Oooooh! 
What was that? " 

But before anyone could tell him it was a rocket, six fireworks went 
off together in the bonfire and a shower of stars shot out everywhere. 
Then a whole bundle of jumping squibs went off at once, and leapt out of 
the fire in a hurry. They jumped right into the middle of the goblins and 
chased them all about the field, hopping now here and now there! The 
three boys laughed till they could laugh no more. 

" This is a good punishment for you! " shouted Tom. The goblins 
heard his voice, and, feeling far more frightened of the fireworks than they 
were of the boys, they ran to Tom, Peter and John, and knelt down before 
them. 

" Tell these things to stop! " wept Snooky. " I don't like all these 
bangs and pops and jumps and sparks! ' 

" BANG ! BANG ! " went another rocket and shot by Snooky's head, 
taking his topknot off as it flew. 

" Come with us," said the boys to the little goblins, and they picked 
them all up and carried them back to the dark shed, far away from the bang- 
ing fireworks in the bonfire. Tom lighted a candle and the three boys 
looked sternly at the trembling goblins. 

" You are bad little scamps," said Peter. " I've no doubt you have 



THE FIREWORK GOBLINS 

many a time stolen other things, as well as our fireworks. Well, you had 
a good punishment this time ! ' 

" And we would just like to know what you are going to do about 
giving us back fireworks in place of those you have taken! " said Tom. 

" You deserve to be popped in the middle of all those fireworks going 
off now," said John and the goblins trembled as they heard the bang-pop- 
bang-pop of the fireworks still going off in the bonfire. 

" Please forgive us and we will try to earn some money for you to buy 
more fireworks," said Snooky in a small voice. 

" Well, come back here to-morrow night, without fail," said Tom. 

" We promise to, on our honour as goblins," said every goblin at once. 
Then they ran off. 

Well, my goodness me, how hard those goblins worked all through 
that night and the next day! They ran errands for witches, they minded 
baby fairies for the elves, they held the rabbits still whilst they were being 
harnessed to the pixie carriages, and they helped a wizard to make a power- 
ful spell that smelt so bad that the goblins felt really ill ! And for all their 
hard work they were paid four pieces of silver. 

They gave these to the three boys the next night, and Tom, John, and 
Peter were very pleased. " Now we shall be able to buy even more fire- 
works than before! " cried Tom. 

And so they did, and had a wonderful time on Firework Night. But 
the goblins were nowhere to be seen. No they were not going to be 
caught anywhere near fireworks again! 

" We won't steal anything any more," said Snooky. " We've learnt 
our lesson! We really, really have! " 



How hard those 




goblins worked.

MACK IWEiT flIOg 



BETTY and Robin were going over Breezy Hill for a walk when they saw 
a narrow path that they had never seen before. 

" Hallo ! " said Robin, in surprise. " Where does that path go to? 
I've never been along it." 

" Perhaps it's just a rabbit-path," said Betty. " There are lots of rabbits 
on Breezy Hill." 

" No, it isn't a rabbit-path," said Robin. " It's too wide for that. 
Let's go down it and see where it leads to, shall we, Betty? ' 

So off they went down the funny little green path, and that was the 
beginning of their strange adventures ! 

When they had gone some way they came to what looked like a tiny 
village just three or four cottages set closely on the hillside with two 
little shops in the middle. One of these was a sweet-shop. 

It was a funny little shop with a small window of thick glass, and 
behind the panes were tall, thin bottles of brightly-coloured sweets. 

" A sweet-shop," said Betty, surprised. " I didn't know there was one 
on this hill, did you, Robin? ' 

" No," said Robin, puzzled. " It's a funny place, Betty. There doesn't 
seem to be anybody about and yet I feel as if people are peeping at us 
from behind curtains. But whenever I look, there's nobody! ' 

Betty looked all round. There was nobody anywhere. The doors of 
the cottages were shut, and not a sound was to be heard. It was a strange 
little place. 

119 



THE MAGIC SWEET SHOP 

Betty pressed her nose to the sweet-shop window and looked at the 
bottles of sweets. She began to read the labels on them. Then she cried 

* 

out in surprise. 

" Robin! These are very queer sweets! Just read what they are! ' 

Robin looked at the labels, and certainly the names of the sweets in 
that sweet-shop were very strange. A bottle of blue sweets was labelled 
Giant-sweets, and a bottle of pink ones was called Dwarf-sweets. 
Another bottle had the label Invisible-sweets, 

" You know, this must be a magic shop," said Betty, excited. " Let's 
go in and buy some of the sweets! I've got a penny and so have you." 

So they pushed open the door, which had a little tinkling bell, and 
went inside the dark shop. At first they thought there was nobody there, 
and then they saw behind the counter a small nobbly-looking man with a 
pair of large spectacles on his long nose. He had a strange tuft of hair 
growing straight up from his head and two long, pointed ears. He was 
sitting by himself reading a brightly coloured newspaper. 

When the bell rang he looked up. He didn't seem at all surprised to 
see the children. 

4 What do you want this morning? " he asked, folding up his news- 
paper neatly. 

; * Could we have a pennyworth of mixed sweets each? " asked Robin, 
eagerly. ** They look such funny sweets." 

6 There's nothing funny about them at all," said the shopman, 
twitching his pointed ears like a dog. " They're quite ordinary." 

He took five bottles from the window and emptied some sweets into 
his scales. Betty looked at the labels on the bottles so that she would know 
which of the sweets were which. She saw that a Giant-sweet, a Dwarf- 
sweet, an Invisible-sweet, and two others, one a Spiky-sweet and the other 
a Home-again-swcct, were put into the scales. She felt very much excited. 

Each of them was handed a bag of these sweets by the shopman. He 
took their pennies and put them into a tin box. Then he picked up his 
newspaper and began to read it again. 

* Shut the door when you go out," he said. 

Tfccy ran out and shut the door carefully behind them. Then they 
stopped outside to look at their very strange sweets. They didn't like to 
eat them in case anything queer happened to them. 

120 



THE MAGIC SWEET SHOP 




" What will happen if we cat these sweets ? ** asked Bety. 

" Shall we go back into the shop and ask the man there to tell us what 
will happen if we eat these sweets? " said Robin. Betty nodded so back 
they went. 

" What will happen if we eat these sweets? " asked Betty, putting her 
head in at the door. 

4 Try, and see! " answered the shopman, without looking up from 
his queer newspaper. " Shut the door, please." 

The children didn't like to ask him any more so they went outside 
again. They walked up the little crooked street, talking hard about their 
strange sweets. They didn't look where they were going, and they were 
surprised when they came to a big white gate that was placed right across 
the road so that they could go no further. 

" This is stranger and stranger," said Robin puzzled. " I've never 
seen that village before, and now here is a gate across the road that Fvc 
never seen before either." 

121 



THE MAGIC SWEET SHOP 

" We've never been this way," said Betty. " What shall we do? 
Climb over the gate? We are nearly at the top of the hill/' 

" Yes, let's," said Robin. So over the gate they climbed. They 
walked on down a lane lined on each side by great hedges of hawthorn, 
whose blossoms were as thick as snow. It was lovely. 

They came to the top of the hill and looked down. To their great 
surprise they saw quite a town on the other side! 

" How queer! " said Betty. " There has never been anything on the 
other side of this hill before. Now there are houses and shops everywhere ! " 

They went on down the hill towards the town, and soon came to some 
most peculiar-looking people. They were very round, and their arms were 
very long indeed. Their faces were as red as tomatoes and they all wore big 
white ruffs round their necks, which made their faces seem redder than ever. 

Some of them were riding in small motor-cars, rather like toy-motors 
but with hoods like sun-shades instead of proper hoods. Betty and Robin 
stared in astonishment. 

They stood in the middle of the road and looked about at the queer 
folk. A motor-car with a bright yellow hood came along at a tremendous 
pace. Robin jumped to one side, but Betty was just too late and the little 
car ran into her. To her great amazement it exploded like an air-balloon 
and flew up into the air in a hundred pieces ! She wasn't hurt at all, but 
simply fell over into the road. 

The little round man in the car shot up in the air and down again. 
He landed with a bump by Betty and he was cross ! 

" You silly, stupid, foolish, ridiculous girl! " he cried. " Why didn't 
you get out of my way? Look what you've done to my car. It's gone pop ! " 

" Well," said Betty, getting up and dusting herself. " I'm sorry 
about it, but you had no right to come along at such a dreadful pace. 
You didn't even hoot." 

" You horrid, nasty, rude, selfish girl! " cried the man, looking as if 
he was going to smack Betty. But Robin was not going to have his sister 
spoken to like that, so he pushed the man away and spoke sharply to him. 

" Now then, now then ! Don't speak to Betty like that ! Haven't you 
any manners? You might have hurt her very much running into her like 
that! It's a good thing your car has gone pop because you won't be able 
to drive like that again for a little while! ' 

122 



THE MAGIC SWEET SHOP 




He landed with a bump by Betty and he was cross. 

The little round man went quite purple with rage. He took a trumpet 
from his pocket and blew loudly on it. " Tan-tara! Tan-tara! " 

At once a whole crowd of the funny-looking people came running 
up and took hold of Betty and Robin. 

" Take them to prison! " shouted the man whose motor-car had 
exploded. " Give them nothing but bread and water for sixty days! " 

Robin was very angry but he could do nothing against so many, and 
he and Betty were marched off to a big yellow building and locked up in 
a tiny cell together. Robin banged on the door but it was no use. It was 
locked and bolted on the outside. 

" Look here, Betty! " said Robin, suddenly. " Let's eat one of these 
sweets each. Perhaps something will happen to help us then! r 

So they each picked from their bags a blue sweet and put it into their 
mouths. And before they had half-eaten them a very curious thing hap- 
pened ! They began to grow taller. Yes, and fatter, too ! In fact they were 
soon giant-like, and their heads touched the cell ceiling. 

" I say! Those must have been the sweets out of the Giant-sweet 

123 



THE MAGIC SWEET SHOP 

bottle! " said Robin, in excitement. He kicked at the cell-door and it 
nearly broke, for his feet were now very big. 

" Stop that! " cried an angry voice outside. " If you kick your door 
again, prisoners, I shall come in and smack you both! ' 

" Ho! " said Robin, pleased. " I shall certainly kick it again! Then 
when it's opened, Betty, we'll walk out and give everyone a shock! " 

" Bang, bang, bang ! " he kicked the door hard again. At once it was 
unbolted and unlocked and a very angry keeper came in. But when he saw 
Betty and Robin both as tall as the ceiling, nearly filling up the whole 
cell, his red face turned pale and he fled for his life ! 

" Now we'll go out," said Robin, and he and Betty somehow managed 
to squeeze themselves out of the door ! They walked out of the prison, 
seeing everyone run in fear before them. How they laughed to see the 
astonishment on the red faces of the townsfolk, who now looked very 
small indeed to the children. 

They went down the street, frightening everyone they met, and soon 
came to cross-roads. There was a signpost there, and on one arm was 
printed " To Giantland." 

"Goodness! " said Betty. "How exciting! We are giants now, 
Robin, so do let's take this road to Giantland. It would be fun to see 
some giants." 

So they took the road to Giantland, feeling more and more excited. 
After half-an-hour's walk they came to some enormous trees and knew 
that they were coming near to Giantland. They were soon there after that 
but dear me, the giants were far bigger than the children had guessed 
they would be! Although Robin and Betty were much bigger than they 
were usually, they were still very small compared with the giants! 

A very large giant with eyes like dinner-plates saw them first. He 
gaped at them in surprise and then called to his friends, in a voice like 
thunder. 

"HIE! LOOK HERE! HERE ARE SOME QUEER 
CHILDREN! " 

In a trice the children were surrounded by a dozen enormous 
giants. They didn't like it at all. One of the giants poked his finger 
into Robin's chest. 

" He's real," he said, in a booming voice. " He's not a doll." 

124 



THE MAGIC SWEET SHOP 

"Of course I'm not a doll! " shouted Robin, crossly. "Don't 
poke me like that! ' 

It amused the giants to see how cross Robin was, and they 
poked him again with their big, bony fingers. Robin felt sure he 
would be bruised all over. 

" Aren't they nasty, unkind creatures," said Betty, almost crying, 
for she didn't like the great giants with their enormous eyes and teeth 
like piano-keys. " Can't we escape, Robin! ' 

" How can we? " said Robin, trying to push away a finger that came 
to tickle him. " Oh, Betty, I know! Let's eat another sweet! ' 

In a great hurry the children took out their sweet-bags and ate a pink

Robin was.

sweet each. In an instant they felt themselves growing smaller and smaller 
smaller and smaller. 

The giants seemed to grow bigger and BIGGER and BIGGER. Soon 
they were so big that they seemed like mountains ! The children were tinier 
than sparrows to the giants tinier than lady-birds even ! 

"Quick! " said Betty, catching hold of Robin's hand. " Quick! 
Let's go somewhere safe before their great feet tread on us! ' 

There was a large hole in the ground not far from them and Betty and 
Robin ran to it. It seemed like a dark tunnel to them, but really it was a 
worm-hole! The children were now so small that even a worm-hole 
was enormous to them. 

Down the tunnel they went, and suddenly came to a thing that looked 
like a large snake. It was a worm that squeezed itself against the tunnel side 
most politely so that they might go past. They ran on, rather frightened. 
A great beetle hurried by them, treading heavily on Betty's toes. It was all 
rather alarming. 

" I wish we could get out of here," said Robin, after a time. " Oh look, 
Betty! There's a tiny pin-hole of light far ahead of us. That must be 
where the worm-hole ends. Come on! ' 

On they went and at last came out into a wonderful place of sunshine 
and green grass. Nobody was about at all, but not far away were some 
great red and brown animals. 

" They must be giant cows," said Betty, looking at them. " I hope 
they won't eat us! * 

The cows saw the two small children and walked over to them. One 
cow put her head down to nibble at them. Robin ran away and pulled 
Betty with him. The giant cows followed, very curious about these little 
creatures in their field of grass. 

Betty was afraid she would be gobbled up by one of the enormous 
cows. She ran from buttercup to buttercup trying to hide. Then she 
noticed that, as the cows ate the grass, they left out the prickly thistles 
and would not touch them. And a good idea came into her head. 

' Robin! Let's eat one of the Spiky-sweets," she cried. " I know 
which they are the yellow ones ! I don't know what will happen to us, 
but if we grow prickles the cows won't eat us. They will think we are 
a kind of thistle! " 

126 



THE MAGIC SWEET SHOP 

So they each took a yellow 
sweet and ate it. Then they looked 
at one another in surprise for at 
once dozens of spikes and prickles 
grew out all over them ! They were 
as prickly as thistles and holly 
leaves ! The cows soon left them 
alone then, and went off to another 
part of the field in disgust. 

Betty and Robin ran down a 
very big rabbit-hole, and frightened 
a family of rabbits very much 
indeed as they went. They ran on 
until they came to where the hole 
led up to the open air again and 
then out they rushed into the sun- 
shine. 

They were on a green hillside, 
and nearby was a notice which said: 
" Broomstick Hill. Trespassers 
will be turned into Snails." 

"Ooh! " said Betty, alarmed. " Look at that notice! " 
But they hardly had time to read the notice again before there came 
a whirring in the air, and to the children's enormous surprise about a 
hundred witches came flying through the sky on long broom-sticks, dark- 
ening the sunshine as they gathered together like black clouds. Then down 
to the green hillside they flew together. 

And, of course, the very first thing their sharp eyes saw was Betty, her 
black hair flying in the wind, and her prickles all round her! Robin had 
hidden behind a bush, but Betty was so surprised to see the witches that 
she hadn't even thought of hiding ! 

Just as the witches came rushing over towards them Robin pulled 
Betty down beside him. " Get out your sweet-bag and eat a sweet! " he 
whispered. " We've got two left. Eat the purple one and we'll see what 
happens! ' 

" Where are those trespassing children! " cried the witches. ' We 

127 




Oh," said Betty. "Look at that 
notice." 



THE MAGIC SWEET SHOP 

will turn them into snails ! How dare they come to our hillside and listen 
to all we say! ' 

Betty and Robin popped their purple sweets hurriedly into their 
mouths. They looked at one another and to their great astonishment 
they couldn't see each other. At first they didn't know what had happened, 
and then they guessed the sweets had made them invisible! 

Betty put out her hand and tried to find Robin. She felt him and took 
his hand in hers. He was rather prickly but she didn't mind. She dragged 
him down the hillside and then looked back at the witches. They were 
hunting in astonishment all around the bush where they had seen Betty. 

" There is no one here! " they cried. " Where have they gone? * 

By this time Betty and Robin were at the bottom of the hill. They 
could not see one another but they held hands very firmly in case they lost 
each other. 

" I'm tired of this adventure," said Betty, at last. " Are you, Robin? 
We always seem to be chased by something giants, or cows, or witches. 
Goodness knows what it will be next time! Let's go home." 

" But we don't know the way," said Robin, looking all round. " Fm 
hungry and I'd love to go home. I wish I did know the way! ' 

" Let's eat the last sweet and see what happens," said Betty, feeling for 
her sweet bag. " We've eaten all but the Home-again sweets, and maybe 
they will take us home! " 

So they put a red sweet into their mouths. Before they had finished 
eating it they could see one another and all their prickles had gone ! They 
were so pleased, for they were both tired of being so very prickly! They 
waited to see what else would happen. Would a big wind come and take them 
home? Or would their legs walk them safely back? What would happen? 

Nothing happened at all. They just sat there at the bottom of the hill 
and waited in the sunshine. But still nothing happened. It was very queer. 
Wouldn't the Home-again sweets take them back home? If not, how 
could they get home? They were quite sure they would never be able to 
find their way! 

And then Betty began to look around her. She saw a big birch tree 
that she seemed to know. She noticed a house not far off. She heard a 
milk-cart clattering along a road a little distance away and she suddenly 
jumped up with a cry of delight. 

128 



THE MAGIC SWEET SHOP 

" Robin ! We are home ! This is the hill just outside our own garden ! 
That's our house over there! There's the milkman's cart, look! Why 
we're home and didn't know it! However could we have got here! I'm 
sure the hill outside our garden isn't really a witch's hill." 

They were most astonished, but it was quite true they were home 
again, for they were just outside their garden, and they could even hear 
their gardener whistling a tune to himself as he hoed the garden beds ! 

" Well, how surprising ! " said Robin, standing up. " We're safely back 
after a lot of queer adventures. Let's go and tell mother. Perhaps she'll 
come with us and see that funny magic sweet-shop." 

OfT they went, and that evening they took their mother up the hill- 
side to find the sweet-shop. They followed the little path but alas, it did 
not lead to any sweet-shop; only to a great many rabbit-holes! 

" It's just a rabbit-path! " said mother. " You must have dreamed it 
all, my dears! ' 

But they really didn't you know! 



Beware of the Snake 

E'*s make a funny snake today. This is a very good thing to do on a rainy 
afternoon in the holidays, if you have already got the material collected. 
All you want for your snake are plenty of acorn cups of all sizes, and one nice 
large acorn. 

Now, take your acorn and draw eyes and mouth on it. That's easy ! Now get a 
strong needle and thread it with black cotton, the strongest Mother has. 

Push the needle through the acorn, which is to be the snake's head, drawing the 
cotton after it. The cotton should have a knot at the end, and a bit beyond it, to 

make the tongue. Look at the picture and see. 
Now choose your biggest acorn cups, and 
begin to thread them one after the other. They 
will fit into each other as you thread them. Choose 
smaller and smaller ones so that the snake's body 
tapers nicely. Finish the body off with a knot, 
leaving a bit of cotton to make the tip of the tail. 
And there's your nice wriggly 
snake ! You can make him 
as long as you like. 





The Goblin Looking-Glass 

IT was a very wet day and Micky and Pam couldn't go out to play in the 
garden. They were cross about it because they wanted to dig in their 
sand-pit. They stood at the window and grumbled. 

" It's no use being cross, my dears," said Nurse. " Get your bricks or 
your books and amuse yourselves. I am going down to help Mummy to 
make a new dress for Pam, so be good whilst I am gone." 

Nurse took her work-basket and went downstairs. The children were 
left alone. They turned away from the window and stared round the 
nursery. 

" I don't want to play with bricks," said Micky. " And I'm tired of 
all my books. I wish something exciting would happen." 

" Nothing lovely ever happens ! " sighed Pam. " You read of such 
glorious adventures in books but nothing ever really happens to children 
like us." 

' There isn't even anything very exciting in the nursery," said Micky. 
' We haven't a gramophone like Peter has. And we haven't a nice clock- 
work railway like Jack's. There's nothing nice in our nursery at all." 

: * No, nothing except the big looking-glass," said Pam, pointing to 
a full-length mirror hung on the wall. The children liked this very much 
because they could see all of themselves in it, from top to toe. Round the 
mirror was carved a most exciting pattern of fruits, flowers and tiny little 

130 



THE GOBLIN LOOKING-GLASS 

goblin-like creatures peeping out from the flowers. It really was a lovely 
looking-glass. 

Pam and Micky liked to look into it and see their nursery reflected 
there, the other way round. Micky looked at the mirror on that wet, rainy 
morning, and an idea came into his head. 

" I wonder if there is anything magic about that mirror," he said, 
going over to it. " You know, it's very, very old, Pam. Let's look care- 
fully at all those little goblins carved round it and see if we think there's 
any magic about them." 

So the two children looked carefully at each goblin, and rubbed each 
one to see if anything happened. But nothing did. Micky was disappointed. 
He leaned against the mirror and looked into it at the nursery reflected 
there. 

And then he saw a most queer and curious thing. He saw standing in 
the mirror-nursery a little, carved chair, just by the fire-place but when 
he looked back into the real nursery there was no chair at all! 

" Pam! Pam! Look here! " he cried, excitedly. " Look into the 
mirror. Do you see that funny carved chair, standing by the fire-place? 
Well, it's in the mirror, but it isn't in our nursery! What do you think 
of that! " 

Pam looked. Sure enough, it was just as Micky had said. A small 
carved chair stood in the looking-glass but it wasn't in the real nursery 
at all. It was only in the looking-glass. It was carved like the mirror itself, 
and seemed to match it perfectly. Whose was it? Who sat there? And 
why was it in the looking-glass but not in the nursery itself? 

" Pam, Pam ! Something exciting has happened at last ! " cried Micky. 
He pressed his face against the glass to try and see further into the mirror 
and suddenly he gave a great cry of surprise and fell right through the 
mirror into the reflection beyond! 

Pam stared in astonishment. There was Micky on the other side of 
the mirror, staring at her, too surprised to speak. Then she heard his voice, 
sounding rather far away. 

" Pam! I'm the other side of the mirror! Take my hand and come 
too. We'll have a real adventure ! ' 

Pam stretched out her hand and took Micky's. He gave her a pull and 
she passed right through the looking-glass and stood beside Micky. They 

131 



THE GOBLIN LOOKING-GLASS 




" Pam 1 I'm on the other side of the mirror ! Take my hand and come too," 

looked back at their nursery and as they looked, they saw the door open 
and Nurse come in. 

" Don't let her see us," whispered Micky. " It would spoil everything. 
Quick, hide! " 

He ran out of the door in the mirror with Pam. They expected to find 
themselves on the broad, sunny landing that lay outside their own nursery 
door but the looking-glass house was different. Instead of a wide 
landing there was a narrow, dark passage. Micky stopped. 

' This is funny," he said. " It's quite different from our house. I 
wonder where we really are, now." 

Pam felt a bit frightened and wanted to go back, but Micky wouldn't 

132 



THE GOBLIN LOOKING-GLASS 



let her. No, this was an adventure, 
and he wanted to go on with it. 

" There's nothing to be afraid 
of," he said. " I'll look after you." 

He took Pam along the dark 
passage and came at last to stairs 
going up and down. They were 
queer stairs, going in a spiral, and 
the children wondered whether to 
go up them or down them. They 
decided to go up them. 

So up they went and came at 
last to a big, grey door set with 
orange nails. They pushed it open 
and looked inside. And they saw a 
very strange sight! 

A small goblin-like man, with 
funny, pointy ears, sat hunched up 
in a corner by a big fire-place, 
leaning over a large red book. 




A small goblin-like man with funny 
pointy ears. 



Tears were running down his cheeks and made a big pool at his feet. 
The children stared at him in surprise. 

" What's the matter? " asked Micky, at last. The goblin jumped so 
much with fright that his book nearly fell into the fire. He snatched it out 
and sat down again on his stool, holding his hand to his beating heart. 

" Oh! " he said. " Oh! What a fright you gave me! I thought you 
were Bom, the big goblin. How in the world did you get here? ' 

" Oh, never mind that," said Micky. " We are here that's all. 
What were you crying for? ' 

' f Look at this book," said the goblin, beginning to cry again. :< It's 
a book of recipes. I've got to make some special lemonade for Bom, and I 
can't read very well, so I just simply can't find out how to make it ! There 
are such long words here and Bom will whip me and stand me in a 
corner all night if I haven't got the lemonade ready when he comes back." 

"I'// read it for you! " said Micky. He took the book and read 
out loud. 




It came back with a small jar of honey. 



THE GOBLIN LOOKING-GLASS 

" Enchanted Lemonade. To 
Make Take the juice of five 
lemons that have grown best in 
moonlight. Take some yellow 
honey from the bumble-bee that 
visits the night-shade on Friday 
evening. Take a spoonful of blue 
sugar. Stir with a Kingfisher's 
feather. Say five enchanted words 
over the mixture." 

" Oh, thank you! " cried the 
small goblin, delighted. :< Now I know exactly what to do. Oh, you 
really are kind and clever. I'll make the lemonade at once! ' 

He took five strange-looking, silvery lemons from a dish in a cup- 
board. Then he found a tiny flute in one of his pockets and blew on it. In 
a moment or two a very large bumble-bee flew in at the open window. The 
goblin spoke to it in a curious humming voice, and the bee flew out. It 
came back in a few minutes with a small jar of yellow honey, which the 
goblin took from it with a smile. Then out flew the bee again. 

Micky and Pam watched in amazement. The goblin shook some blue 
sugar from a bag into a silver spoon and mixed it with the juice of the 
lemons and the honey. Then he took a bright blue feather from a jar and 
stirred the mixture, muttering over it the strangest words that the children 
had ever heard. 

" There! It's made! " said the goblin, happily, putting the bowl of 
lemonade on the window-sill. " Thanks to you, little boy ! But, tell me 
what are you doing here in Bom's house? Does he know you are here? ' 
" No," said Micky. " I didn't even know it was Bom's house. We 
came through the mirror in our nursery, and found everything quite 
different." 

" You came through the mirror ! " cried the little goblin, in fright. 
" Oh, be careful, then! It's years and years since anyone did that. It's a 
sort of trap, you know. Bom always hopes someone will fall through that 
magic mirror one day, and then he finds them and makes them his servants 
for a hundred years. They are allowed to go back then, but, of course, they 
are old and so they never want to. They always end up as goblins, like me." 



THE GOBLIN LOOKING-GLASS 

Micky and Pam listened in astonishment and dismay. They wanted 
an adventure, but not a horrid one. 

" Where is Bom? " asked Micky. " Perhaps we can get back to our 
nursery before he sees us." 

" I don't think you can," said the goblin. " I believe I can hear 
him coming now. Quick, take these they may help you sometime or 
other. Go and hide behind that couch. Maybe Bom won't see you 
then." 

Micky took what the goblin pressed into his hand and then dragged 
Pam behind the couch. It was only just in time. The door opened and 
through it came a magnificent goblin, dressed in a cloak of pure gold and 
a tunic of silver with sapphire buttons. His hat, which he hadn't bothered 
to take off, had a wonderful curling feather in it, and his long, pointed ears 
stuck out below it. 

" Ho, Tumpy ! " said Bom, in a loud voice. " Have you made that 
lemonade? Where is it? ' 

Tumpy, the little goblin, ran to the window-sill and fetched the bowl 




Bom took him up in his big hand and shook him. 



THE GOBLIN LOOKING-GLASS 

of lemonade. To the children's surprise Bom raised it to his lips and drank 
it all off at one gulp. 

" That's good," he said. " Very good." 

Then he stood and sniffed the air as if he could smell something. 

' Tumpy," he said, in an angry voice. " You have had visitors. 
Where are they? " 

Tumpy was very frightened but he wasn't going to give the children 
away. He shook his head and taking up a broom, began to sweep the floor. 
But Bom took him up in his big hand and shook him so hard that Micky 
and Pam were sure they could hear his teeth rattling together. 

Micky was not going to let anyone be hurt for him. So he stepped 
boldly out from behind the couch with Pam. 

" Stop shaking Tumpy," he said. " We are not really his visitors. 
We didn't come to see him." 

Bom dropped Tumpy in surprise, and stared at the two children. 

" Did you come to see me, then? " he asked. " Oh, perhaps you are 
the two children of the Wizard Broody? He told me he was sending them 
out travelling, and that they might perhaps call and see me." 

" Perhaps we are, and perhaps we aren't," said Micky, grandly. " We 
shall not tell you our names." 

Bom looked at them sharply. 

" Well, if you are, you can do two or three things for me," he said. 
" I've a silver canary that won't sing. If you are the Wizard's children, you 
can easily make it sing for me. Then I've a sack of stones I can't turn into 
gold, no matter how I try. You can do that for me, too. Then I've a 
candle that won't light. You must make it light for me. If you can do 
those things I shall know you are the wizard's children and you shall go in 
safety. But if you cannot do them, then who will you be? Perhaps 
children that have come through the goblin mirror! Aha! ' 

Micky put on a bold face, and hoped that Pam would try not to cry. 
He meant to go back to the mirror room as soon as he had a chance, and 
climb through the looking-glass into his own nursery. 

" I'll try to do what you want," he said. " Take us to the canary." 

Bom marched to the door, and the children went after him. Micky 
looked behind him at the little goblin Tumpy, and saw that he was 
pointing and signalling to him. Micky knew why. It was to remind 

136 




He began to stroke the canary. 



THE GOBLIN LOOKING-GLASS 

him that Tumpy had given him 
something. He patted his pocket 
to show Tumpy he remembered, 
and then followed the big goblin 
down the curly stairs. 

Bom took them to a little 
room. There was only one thing 
in it and that was a big golden 
cage with a silver canary in it. 
The little bird sat glumly on its 
perch, and its bright eyes looked 
at Bom and the children when they came in. 

" This is the canary," said Bom. :< He won't sing. Let me see you 
make him open his mouth and trill sweetly." 

" Oh, no, we cannot let you see our magic," said Micky, much to 
Pam's surprise. " You must leave us alone, and come back in half an hour. 
We cannot do magic with a goblin looking on." 

" Very well," said Bom, and he left the room. Micky was delighted. 
He waited until the goblin was gone and then he ran to the door. 

' We can easily escape before he comes back," he whispered to Pam. 
But alas! The door was locked on the outside. The children were 
prisoners. 

Pam began to cry, but Micky wasted no time. He felt in his pocket to 
see what the little goblin Tumpy had given him. He took the things out. 
There was a red feather, very tiny. A shining golden button and a very 
small key. That was all. 

' Well, I don't know what use these are going to be," said Micky, 
dolefully. " A feather, a button and a key! ' 

'' Sh! " said Pam, suddenly. " Can you hear something? ' : 
Micky stood still and listened. He heard a whispering coming through 
the keyhole of the locked door. It must be Tumpy. 

" Stroke the canary with the red feather! " said the whispering voice. 
:e Stroke the canary with the red feather! ' 

Micky at once took the feather and stuck it between the bars of the 
golden cage. He began to stroke the canary with the red feather. He did it 
until he was quite tired, and then he asked Pam to take a turn too. So she 



THE GOBLIN LOOKING-GLASS 




Once more a tiny whisper came through the keyhole. 

stroked the canary for a long time. But he didn't make a movement, and 
he didn't sing a note. It was disappointing. 

" That horrid big goblin will be back again soon," sighed Micky, still 
stroking the canary. :< Oh, I wonder if this is any use." 

Just as he said that the canary gave a tiny chirruping noise. Then it 
suddenly took the red feather in its beak and tucked it into the silvery 
feathers that grew from its throat. Micky watched in surprise. 

The canary hopped up and down in its cage. Then it opened its 
mouth and began to sing. How it sang ! It was the loudest song the chil- 
dren had ever heard ! The door burst open and in came Bom, looking very 
surprised and pleased. 

" Well, well, I didn't think you'd do that so quickly! " he cried. " The 
Wizard Broody must have taught you a great deal of magic ! Now come 
and change my sack of stones into gold for me ! Ho ho ! You shall have a 
great feast and two big precious stones for yourselves when your tasks 
are finished! ' 

The children left the singing canary and once more followed Bom, 
this time into a curious little room hung round with black curtains, 
embroidered with goldfish. In the middle was a big sack. Bom pulled it 
open at the neck. It was full of stones. 

" Here you are," he said. " Change these into gold for me. I'll go 
away again if you don't like me to watch you." 



THE GOBLIN LOOKING-GLASS 

He went out and banged the door. Once more Micky ran to it and 
tried it but no, it was fast locked. He stared in despair at the sack. Then 
he looked behind all the curtains to see if there was a door or window, 
but there wasn't. The only light came from a great lantern hung from the 
low ceiling. 

" Micky! There's that whispering again! " said Pam, in a low voice. 
Micky rushed to the door and listened. Once more a tiny whisper came 
through the keyhole. " Put the shiny button in the sack. Put the shiny 
button in the sack." 

" It must be Tumpy again," said Micky, gladly. " What a good thing 
we were able to help him make that magic lemonade, Pam! ' 

He took the golden button from his pocket and slipped it in the sack. 
It fell down between the stones and disappeared. Micky watched to see 
what would happen, quite expecting the stones to turn at once to gold. 
But they didn't. 

The children watched and watched them but they still remained grey 
stones. They were afraid Bom would come back and goodness me, just 





This is a witch's candle," said Bom. " If only I could light it." 

I 39 



THE GOBLIN LOOKING-GLASS 




" Goodness 1 " cried Micky suddenly. " They must be the wizard's children." 

as they were thinking he surely must be back soon, they heard the door 
opening. It was Bom! 

Micky shut the sack quickly, hoping that he and Pam could slip out 
of the door before Bom could see the stones had not changed to gold. But 
the wily Bom had locked the door behind him! 

He pulled open the sack and to the children's great amazement they 
saw that the stones had changed to shining gold after all ! There they were, 
yellow and bright. They must just have changed as the goblin came into 
the room. 

" Smart children! " said Bom, pleased. " Clever children! I didn't 
think you'd be able to do that! I shall write and tell your father you are 
very clever indeed. Now come and light the candle that won't light ! Then 
you shall have a grand feast, and go home with two fine emeralds in your 
pockets! " 

Micky and Pam followed him to yet another room, this time set with 
many sunny windows. On a pink table was a tall golden candlestick and in 
it stood a pink candle. 

" This is a witch's candle," said Bom. " If only I could light it, it 
would burn for ever. Light it for me. I will leave you alone for a while." 

Out he went and locked the door behind him. Micky ran to listen to 
any whispering that might come but oh dear me, Bom must have come 
back and caught poor Tumpy at the key-hole, for hardly had the whisper- 

140 



THE GOBLIN LOOKING-GLASS 

ing begun than there came the sound of an angry voice, and several sharp 
slaps. Then somebody began to cry and was hustled away. 

" That was poor old Tumpy, I expect," said Micky. " Now we 
shan't know how to light that witch-candle ! Well, I've only got one thing 
left, and that's a little key. I'll see if I can do anything with that." 

He took it out and ran it up and down the candle. Then he struck a 
match from a box lying nearby and tried to light the candle. But no, it 
wouldn't light. Micky did everything he could think of, but it wasn't a 
bit of good. Nothing would make that strange pink candle come alight. 
Pam was looking out of one of the windows. Not one of them would 
open, but she was looking out to see what lay beyond. There was a won- 
derful garden set with big, brilliant flowers, and flying about were the 
brightest, strangest birds she had ever seen. Pam stared as if she couldn't 
believe her eyes. Then she saw something else. 

" Micky! " she called. " Come here! Look at these two queer chil- 
dren coming up the path to the house." 

Micky looked. Certainly the children were queer. They both had on 

pointed hats, and long, sweeping 
cloaks on which were embroidered 
moons, suns and stars. They 
carried long, golden sticks in their 
hands. 

" Goodness ! ' cried Micky, 
suddenly. " They must be the 
Wizard's children the ones he 
mistook us for ! Now what are we 
going to do ! Bom will soon know 
we are not the right children, and 
he will be very angry! Oh dear, 
whatever shall we do! ' 

Pam looked wildly round the 
room and suddenly her eyes 
caught sight of a very small door, 
not more than eighteen inches 
high, set at the foot of one of 
the walls. 




Micky tried it. It fitted 1

THE GOBLIN LOOKING-GLASS 

"Look, Micky!" she cried. "There's a tiny door over there! 
Do you think we might perhaps open it and squeeze through? " 

Micky looked and in a moment he was down on his knees trying 
to open it. But it was locked ! He groaned. 

"Try that tiny key you've got! " whispered Pam, in excitement. 
"It might fit! " 

Micky tried it, with trembling hands. It fitted ! He turned it in the 
lock and pushed open the door. And at that very moment there came an 
angry voice outside the room, and the children heard the big door 
opening. 

"I'll punish them! " cried Bom's voice. " Telling me they were 
Wizard children when they weren't! I'll make them my servants for a 
hundred years! Ho ho! ' 

Micky pushed Pam through the tiny door and then squeezed hur- 
riedly through it himself, just as Bom rushed into the room. The angry 
goblin saw them going through the little door and he rushed over to 
them. But he was far too big to get through it himself! 

" I'll go round the other way and catch you! " he roared. 

The children found themselves in a low passage. They stumbled along 
and suddenly Micky felt a little hand in his, and a voice spoke to him. 

:< Don't be afraid, it's only me, Tumpy ! I've come to guide you to 
the looking-glass room. If we're quick we shall get there before Bom does." 




" I'll come back again to-night," he whispered. 
142 



THE GOBLIN LOOKING-GLASS 

Micky was so glad to have Tumpy ! He hurried along with him, Pam 
following close behind. Down long twisty passages they went, in and out 
of funny little rooms, upstairs and downstairs and once through a dim, 
dark cellar. It was terribly exciting. 

At last Tumpy pushed them into a room that seemed very familiar. 
Yes, it was the looking-glass room at last! It was just like their nursery. 
Over on the wall was the long mirror. 

" Quick! Quick! He's coming! " cried Tumpy, and the two chil- 
dren heard the sound of hurried footsteps and a loud, angry voice. Micky 
rushed to the mirror and leapt through it. He helped Pam through, 
and then suddenly thought of dragging the little goblin Tumpy through 
too. It seemed such a shame to leave him behind to the cross and unkind 
Bom. So he went through as well! 

Micky looked round. He was in his own, proper nursery. How glad 
he was! So was Pam. Micky looked into the glass. He saw Bom the big 
goblin suddenly appear there, shaking his fist at them. Then he faded 
away, and Micky could see nothing but the reflection of his own nursery. 
Not even the funny little goblin chair was there now. 

Tumpy heard footsteps outside the nursery door and he jumped out 
of the window. " I'll come back again to-night! " he whispered. 

Nurse came into the room, smiling. 

" Well, have you been good children? " she asked. 

" Oh yes," said Micky. " We've had a lovely time! " 

" That's splendid," said Nurse. " Well, it's stopped raining, so you 
can go out. Go and get your rubber boots." 

They went, and when they were in the dark hall-cupboard, putting 
on their boots, Micky spoke to Pam in a low voice. 

" Did it really happen, Pam? Or did we imagine it? Did we go 
through that looking-glass? " 

" Yes, rather! " said Pam. " Anyway, Tumpy came back with us. 
You can ask him if it was true or not, when he comes to see us to-night! 
What an adventure we've had! ' 

And now they are waiting to see Tumpy again. I wish I could see him 
too!

Do your toy soldiers ever go to camp? No, 
you say, because they haven't any tents! 

Well, let's make some, then we can have a 
proper soldiers' camp. You want scissors, some 
fairly thick white paper, a pair of compasses, and 
some gum or seccotine. Ready? Now first, on 
your piece of paper, draw a straight line. Now 
with your compasses draw a half-circle, as in 
Picture i. Done that? 

Now draw a neat V where you see it marked 
in the picture. Cut out the V. Picture 2. 

Now roll the paper round to the shape of a 
little tent, and brush some gum down the edges. 
Pin the edges together till the gum holds. Picture 3 .

he Tale of 



F 
JUBBL 



SQUEAK 




BUBBLE and Squeak, the brownies, lived in No-no Village. Their cot- 
tage was all by itself, right at the very end, so the two brownies did 
just what they liked, and nobody said they were not to. 

They were cunning little creatures, the two of them, up to all sorts of 
tricks. They used to drive Dame Tuffles's hen into the hedge and keep her 
there till she laid an egg for them. They sometimes pulled the biggest branch 
of Mister Yum's apple-tree right down over the wall and picked off all 
the apples they could reach, as fast as they could. Oh, they were 
full of tricks, and loved to get something for 
nothing ! 

But one day they went too far, and were 
well punished, as you will hear. It all began as 
they were coming home from market one 
afternoon, going over Bumblebee Common, 
singing at the tops of their voices. 

" Sh! " said Bubble, as they came near a 
very lonely little cottage. " Here's Wizard 
Once-a-Day's house. Go quietly, or he'll 
come out and chase us." 

So they went very quietly indeed, and as 
they went they heard a loud sound of hissing 
and cackling. They knew what that was ! 

"It's pnce-a-Day's Geese," said Squeak. A$ were coming hom 
He has the nnest in the kingdom, Bubble. f rom Market. 




THE TALE OF BUBBLE AND SQUEAK 

My, they must lay him enough eggs to give him fried, boiled, and 
scrambled eggs three times a day! ' 

" No, he has them once a day, made into a big egg-pudding," said 
Bubble. " A goose egg is very big, Squeak big enough to make a whole 
meal for both of us. If only we had a goose! It would be fun to have 
goose-egg each day." 

" Sh ! " said Squeak. " I can hear Once-a-Day talking. Let's peep 
through the hedge and see who he's talking to." 

So they peeped through a hole in the hedge but they could not see 
who the wizard was talking to because he wasn't talking to anyone. 
He was talking to himself. 

" I haven't enough geese," he was saying. " I need three more, 
because I sold two to Witch Google the other day, and one to Mister 
Yum. I must make some more." 

" Did you hear that? " whispered Bubble to Squeak, in excitement. 
" He said ' make some more ! ' We shall see how he makes them if we 
keep quiet! ' 

So they kept as quiet as could be and watched and they saw a most 
extraordinary sight. 

In Wizard Once-a-Day's garden grew some very fine gooseberry 
bushes. Once-a-Day went to a bush and looked at it. He picked a fat 
green gooseberry from it, and then another. He picked a third gooseberry 
from another bush. Now he had three. He put them down on the ground 
and drew a chalk circle round them. 

" Now, where's my pot of moonlight dew ? " he said. He went indoors 
and brought out a yellow pot of shining dew that he had collected in the 
moonlight. He splashed a few drops over the three green gooseberries. 

Then he danced round solemnly, holding up his long cloak as he went, 
his tall hat nodding on his big head. He sang a song that the watching 
brownies knew was magic: 

" Gooseberries green, gooseberries round, 
Gooseberries lying upon the ground, 
I don't want your berries, so go away, please, 
But leave me, yes, leave me, your cackling geese! " 

As he finished singing this queer song, the gooseberries began to 
swell. They turned a grey- white colour. They grew feathers. They grew

THE TALE OF BUBBLE AND SQUEAK 




As he finished his queer song the gooseberries began to swell. 

legs. They grew a head on a long neck! Lo and behold, there were no 
green berries in the circle, but three fine grey geese, cackling loudly ! The 
gooseberries had disappeared the geese were there. The two brownies 
opened their mouths wide in astonishment and nearly fell through the 
hole in the hedge. So that was how Wizard Once-a-Day got his flock of 
beautiful geese ! No wonder they all had rather green tails that must be 
the remains of the gooseberries ! 

Once-a-Day sb'pped a loop of string round the neck of each goose and 
led them to the field where the others were feeding. As soon as they saw 
them they cackled loudly in delight, and ran to meet them. 

" Well! " whispered Bubble to Squeak. " What a way to make geese! 

M7 



THE TALE OF BUBBLE AND SQUEAK 

I know now why gooseberries have their funny name. They have goose- 
magic in them. Fancy that! ' 

Once-a-Day heard Bubble whispering, and he called out in a furious 
voice: " Who's there? I'll turn you into a pair of slippers and wear you 
to bed each night ! ' 

" Ooooh! " squealed the brownies, and raced off as fast as ever they 
could. They didn't stop till they got home. 

Now the next day Bubble went out alone. He didn't tell Squeak 
where he was going, and Squeak wondered why. In an hour's time Bubble 
came back, holding something in his hand, his face red with excitement. 

" What's the matter, Bubble? " asked Squeak. " You look as if you 
are ready to burst! ' 

" See!" said Bubble, and he held out his hand to Squeak. In it lay 
a big green gooseberry. 

" Bubble ! You don't mean to say you've stolen one of Once-a-Day's 
gooseberries! " cried Squeak. 

" Well, seeing that we know how to make geese from gooseberries, I 
didn't see why I shouldn't have a try," said Bubble boldly. " Come on, 
Squeak. We'll soon have a goose of our own now! Hurrah! ' 

" Goose-egg for breakfast each day! " sang Squeak. 

" Boiled, fried, or scrambled! " sang Bubble, throwing the goose- 
berry up into the air and catching it again. 

" Don't do that," said Squeak in alarm. " It might roll down the sink 
or something." 

" All right," said Bubble. " Now where shall we make the goose, 
Squeak? In the kitchen here, I think. We don't want to let any one see 
what we are doing. We must say that we bought the goose at market, 
if any one asks us where we got it." 

" But suppose it has greeny feathers in its tail, like Once-a-Day's," 
said Squeak. " Every one will know." 

" We'll cut its tail feathers off," said Bubble. " Where's the chalk, 
Squeak? And we want some of our moonlight dew." 

" They are in the drawer," said Squeak, and he got them out. 
" The chalk is rather small, but it will just do. Now I'll draw the circle 
here." 

He drew a nice big circle on the kitchen floor. Bubble put his green 

148 



THE TALE OF BUBBLE AND SQUEAK 

gooseberry in the middle, and splashed it with dew. " I took the goose- 
berry off Once-a-Day's biggest bush," he said. " He was out shopping. 
Now we'd better dance round and sing the magic song, Squeak." So they 
danced solemnly round the chalk ring, singing loudly: 

" Gooseberry green, gooseberry round, 
Gooseberry lying upon the ground, 
I don't want your berry, so go away, please, 
And leave me, yes, leave me, one of your geese! ' 

They had to alter the last line a little bit, but it didn't seem to matter 
for, as they stopped singing, a strange change came over the gooseberry. 
It turned a grey- white. It grew feathers. It grew legs. It grew a head on a 
long neck ! Lo and behold, the berry vanished and a big grey goose was 
there instead. How marvellous! 

" Oooh! Look at that! " cried the two brownies, jumping up and 
down in excitement. " A goose of our own! A fine grey goose! ' 




" Gooseberry green, gooseberry round 
Gooseberry lying upon the ground." 

149 



THE TALE OF BUBBLE AND SQUEAK 

" Ss-ss-ss-ss! Cackle, cackle, cackle! " said the goose and walked out 
of the chalk circle. It went up to Squeak and pecked him hard on the leg. 

" Oooh! Don't! " said Squeak, and rubbed his leg. " I say, Bubble, 
we forgot to have a loop of string ready to put round the goose's neck. 
Where is there a piece? ' 

" I'll get it," said Bubble. " Ow! Get away, goose! Don't peck me 
in the back like that! Ow! " 

The goose had given Bubble a few hard pecks. " Ss-ss-ss-ss, cackle, 
cackle, cackle! " it said. 

Bubble ran to the string-tin, and got out a big piece of string. He 
made one end into a loop and went to the goose. 

But the goose wasn't going to have string round its neck ! No, no 
it was going to have a fine time on its own ! It pecked Bubble's hand so 
hard that Bubble dropped the string and began to cry. 

The goose waddled into the larder and had a look round. There 
was a meat-pie there. The goose took a good peck at it, and liked 

the taste very much. Before the 




brownies knew

what was hap- 
went down the 
goose's throat and it cackled in 
delight. That tasted good! It 
looked round for something 
else. 

"Bubble! Look! The goose 
is eating all our food! " shouted 
Squeak. " Stop it, stop it! " 

" Stop it yourself," wept 
Bubble, holding his pecked hand. 
" It is a perfectly horrid goose." 

The goose ate three apples, a 
jam tart, a cherry cake, and two 
lettuces. Then it pecked a big hole 
in a loaf of bread. 

:< Come out, come out! ' 
shouted Squeak, smacking the 
goose with a broom. 



150 



THE TALE OF BUBBLE AND SQUEAK 

The goose took the broom in its strong beak and cracked the 
handle in half! 

" Oooh! There's our best broom gone! " said Bubble in dismay. 
" Ow! It's pecked me on the nose, it's pecked me on the nose! " 

" Shoo it outside! " said Squeak. " It's the nastiest bird I ever saw. 
I wish we hadn't made it now." 

" Shoo, shoo, shoo! " shouted Bubble. But the goose wouldn't be 
shooed ! It wandered round the kitchen and pecked at everything it saw. 
It pecked down the pretty blue curtains. It pecked holes in the carpet. It 
pecked at a coat of Bubble's which was hanging on a chair, and tore a 
sleeve right out! 

" Oh! You wicked creature! " yelled Bubble in dismay. " That's 
my Sunday coat. Look what you've done ! ' 

" Ss-ss-ss-ss! " hissed the goose. " Cackle, cackle, cackle! " It was 
having a fine time. 

" Bubble, we can't keep this goose if it's going to behave like this," 
said Squeak in despair. " Do help me to shoo it outside." 

So the two brownies tried to shoo the bird out again but all it did 
was to peck sharply at them, and very soon it seemed as if the goose were 
shooing the brownies, and not the brownies shooing the goose ! They ran 
out of doors. The goose followed them, pecking away at their legs and 
back. They ran down the path and out into the road, crying. 

" Shut the gate, Squeak, shut the gate ! " yelled Bubble. So Squeak 
banged the gate. 

" Now you just stay there, you horrid bird," said Squeak. " We 
are going to find some one to fetch you away. We won't keep you! 
We'll sell you!" 

" Ss-ss-ss-ss, cackle, cackle, cackle ! " said the goose, sounding just as 
jf it were laughing at the brownies. It flew to the top of the gate, flapped 
its great wings, and then flew down into the road. It hurried after the 
brownies. 

" Oooh! It's after us! " cried Bubble. " Run, Squeak, run! " 

Well, that goose chased them up the hill. It chased them over the 
common and it drove them right into Wizard Once-a-Day's garden! 
And there was Once-a-Day, grinning all over his clever face! 

" I was waiting for you," he said to the frightened brownies. " I saw 




There was Once-a-day, 
grinning all over his face.

you steal that gooseberry, Bubble. I hadn't 
gone to market as you thought. I knew if 
you made a magic goose you wouldn't be 
able to manage it, and it would bring you 
back to me! Well, have you had a nice 
time with the goose? ' 

" No," wept the two brownies. " We 
are very sorry we used one of your magic 
gooseberries, Once-a-Day. We hope you 
won't punish us." 

" Oh no," said Once-a-Day, " I don't 
mind a bit. You can go home but take your 
goose with you! ' 

" Take the goose! " cried Bubble. " Oh 
no, Once-a-Day, don't make us take the 
goose! It pecks us to pieces! ' 

" Well, I don't want a goose that some- 
body else has made," said Once-a-Day. 

" Please, please have it," begged the 
brownies, falling down on their knees. " Oh, 
please, Once-a-Day." 

" Now just listen to me, Bubble and 



Squeak," said the wizard, suddenly very stern. :c I know all about you 
two cunning little creatures and your tricks. I'll keep the goose but if I 
hear that you have been sly or mean or dishonest in ANY way I'll send 
the goose down to your cottage. Do you understand? ' : 

" Y-y-yes," stammered the brownies, going very red indeed. 

"Then go," said Once-a-Day, " and I'll keep the goose, just as long 
as you keep your promise ! If you forget it I'll forget the goose and it 
will come running down to peck your fat legs ! ' 

Off went the two sorry little brownies and so far as I know the 
goose hasn't been back to their cottage, so I expect they must be remem- 
bering to keep their promise. I didn't know there was such goose-magic in 
gooseberries, did you? But I'm glad I know why they have such a funny 
name!

Mr. Snifty's Dustbin 

MISTER SNIFTY was a surly old goblin who gave everybody a very bad 
time. He was the head of Greenapple Village and how strict and 
stern he was! 

If any child was late for school he had to take his Saturday penny to 
Mister Snifty. If any one was out too late at night, Mister Snifty went round 
to their house and locked the door then the poor brownie or gnome or 
fairy had to sleep in the front garden. Really, he was a dreadfully strict 
person, and all the people of Greenapple Village groaned and wished they 
could make nice, plump, smiling Mister Jolly their chief. 

But they didn't dare to try and do this because of Mister Snifty's magic 
dustbin. This was a most extraordinary thing. It was about the size of a 
small round table, not so big as an ordinary dustbin, and was bright green. 
But the strange thing about it was this that whatever was put into that 
dustbin disappeared at once! 

So the dustman didn't have to collect the rubbish from Mister Snifty's 
house, because there never was any. As soon as he put an old newspaper 
into the dustbin it was gone for good. And all his broken bottles, old tins, 
potato peel, and other rubbish disappeared in just the same way. It was 
marvellous. It was always empty because everything disappeared in it. 

Now you wouldn't think that any one would be afraid of a magic 
dustbin, would you? But the people of Greenapple were, and for a very 
good reason too. 

153 



MR. SNIFTY'S DUSTBIN 

It was little Dame Smiler who told the story of how she had seen 
Snifty use the dustbin for something quite wrong. 

" I was peeping over the wall," she said, " and I saw that old pixie 
tramp, who sells ferns, knocking at Snifty's door. Snifty told him to go 
away and when he wouldn't go, I saw Snifty take hold of him and his 
ferns and pop him into the dustbin! And when I went to look into the 
dustbin when Snifty was out that afternoon, I couldn't see the old tramp 
there at all. He had gone, like all the rubbish." 

Well, you can guess that the Greenapple folk thought twice, then, 
about offending Snifty. Nobody wanted to be put into his dustbin. So 
they all were very careful, and didn't say a word to make Snifty think 
they were really very tired of him. 

One day Chiddlewinks the pixie sent out invitations to a party and 
he sent one to Snifty too. People thought that was silly for a party with 
Snifty looking on was no fun at all. Why, he always had to win musical 
chairs and blow out the candles on the cake and everything ! 




I saw Snifty take hold of him and his ferns and pop him into the dustbin.' 



MR. SNIFTY'S DUSTBIN 

" You are silly, Chiddlewinks," said every one crossly. But Chiddle- 
winks didn't say a word. He just smiled a most peculiar smile. 

The day of the party came. Chiddlewinks borrowed twelve chairs 
from his friends and some cups and saucers, for he hadn't enough of his 
own. It was to be a very grand party. 

Red-Cheeks, Chiddlewinks' friend, popped in and out of the cottage, 
carrying cups and saucers and chairs and making himself very useful. 
And very often Chiddlewinks and Red-Cheeks would whisper together 
and then laugh loudly. 

For they had a Plan. It was a very daring Plan indeed. The night 
before the party Red-Cheeks was to paint his own dustbin, which was about 
as large as Snifty's, a bright green colour. And he was to steal into Snifty's 
garden and exchange the two dustbins. 

" I don't expect Snifty will notice that your dustbin isn't magic," said 
Chiddlewinks. " Because he just takes off the lid, throws his rubbish in 
without looking and puts the lid on again! ' 

What were they going to do with Snifty's dustbin? Ah, that was the 
daring Plan! 

" I shall cover the top and the sides with red velvet," said Chiddle- 
winks, " so that the dustbin will look very grand indeed like a very smart 
stool ! And I shall put the dustbin, looking like a stool, at the head of the 
table, Red-Cheeks, and you will pretend that jw* are going to sit there. 
That will make Snifty very angry, for he always thinks he should sit at the 
head of everything. He will push you away and sit on the red stool him- 
selfand he'll fall into the dustbin and disappear." 

" Well, don't you go and put the lid on before you cover the stool," 
said Red-Cheeks. " My, what a joke! ' 

The party began. Every one stared in surprise at the fine red velvet 
stool that was at the head of the table. Nobody had seen it before and they 
wondered if Chiddlewinks had bought it. Red-Cheeks was very fussy and 
hustled people to the tea-table, saying, " Now take your seats. Chiddle- 
winks is just going to pour out tea." 

Snifty was there, of course, looking extra grand in a blue silk suit with 
buttons down the back and front. He frowned at Red-Cheeks, and then he 
saw that the little fellow was actually going to put himself at the head of the 
table on that grand red velvet stool! That was too much for Snifty. 

155 



MR. SNIFTY'S DUSTBIN 




The velvet gave way beneath Snifty's weight. 

He pushed Red-Cheeks so hard that he fell over. " Make way for me," 
he said in his Grossest voice. " I think this is my seat ! ' 

" It is, it is! " squealed Red-Cheeks in delight as he saw Snifty sitting 
down hard on the red velvet cloth that was spread over the top of the 
dustbin. 

The velvet gave way beneath Snifty's weight it fell into the dustbin 
and Snifty fell with it, clutching at the table as he went. He fell right inside 
it and Red-Cheeks pushed his legs in to make sure! 

Then, before their eyes, the folk of Greenapple Village saw their 
surly, strict chief disappear, just as he had made the old tramp disappear 
before. He was gone! 

How they yelled and cheered! and it wasn't long before Mister 
Jolly was made chief, and as he was as nice as his name, Greenapple 
Village was soon very happy and contented indeed. 

As for old Snifty, goodness knows where he went to ! Anyway, he's 
gone to all his old bottles and peel and tins and the old tramp too. So 
he'll have plenty of company, won't he? 



GOOD 

GRACIOUS, 

BRUINY 





JACK had a big brown bear on wheels. It really 
was a lovely one. Jack could ride on its back, 
or wheel it by its handle, and he often took it out 
on his walks with him. 

Bruiny had a growl. Jack could make 
him growl if he pulled a string in Bruiny's 
neck. Then Bruiny said " Urrrrrrr! " in 
a lovely deep voice. He was a nice, com- 
fortable bear, and Jack loved him. He did 
wish the bear could talk to him but 
Bruiny could only growl, and that might 
mean anything. 

One day Bruiny and Jack had a big 
adventure. They were walking down the 
lane, Jack pushing Bruiny by the handle, 
when there came a great noise of shouting from the field nearby. 

And out of the hedge jumped a gnome carrying a bag ! He leapt 
on a tiny bicycle, and rode off at 
top speed. After him, squeezing 
through the hedge, came two 
small brownies with long beards. 
" Oh, the rascal, oh, the 
rogue ! ' : ' said one. " He's gone 
off with all our gold! ' 

" And he's on a bicycle so that 
we can't catch him! " said the 
other. " There isn't even a rabbit 



Jack was pushing Bruiny by 
the handle. 




we can ride on! 



He leapt on a tiny bicycle. 



GOOD GRACIOUS, BRUINY 

Jack stared hard at the little men. He knew quite well they were fairy 
folk and he was most excited. He pulled Bruiny's string and Bruiny 
growled. " Urrrrrrrrr! ' 

" Good gracious ! " said the two brownies, and they jumped round at 
once. " A bear ! " they cried. " A fine strong bear ! We'll ride after the 
gnome on him! ' 

" But he's only a toy one," said Jack. " He has to be pushed. He 
won't go by himself." 

" Oh, yes, he will, if we rub a little magic ointment on his legs," said 
the first brownie. " Will you lend him to us for a little while? " 

" Yes, if I can come too," said Jack. 

" All right," said the brownies. " There is room for all of us on the 
bear's back. We are small." 

One of them took a jar of ointment from his pocket and rubbed it on 
Bruiny's legs. At once Bruiny waggled his legs and jumped right off his 
four big wheels ! There he stood, quite alive, his little brown head shaking 
jn delight, and his ears twitching. 

" Come on! " said Bruiny, in a growly voice. " I'll catch the thief 
for you. Urrrrrrrrr! ' 

Jack got on his back. He was so excited. The brownies got on too, 
one in front of Jack and one behind. 

" Gee up ! " cried the front one. 

And Bruiny geed up ! My goodness, how 
he galloped along! It was the first time he 
had ever used his legs properly and didn't 
he enjoy it ! Jack had to hold on quite tightly 
in case he fell off. 

" Good gracious, Bruiny! " he shouted. 
" I never thought you'd come alive and 
what a pace you can go! ' 

In a few minutes they saw the gnome 
pedalling along on his bicycle in front of them. 
" UrrrrrRRRRR! " growled Bruiny, in his 
loudest voice. 

The gnome heard the noise and looked

back. When he saw the bear, and Jack with Bruiny's legs. 




GOOD GRACIOUS, BRUINY 







Jack got on his back and the brownies got on too. 

the Brownies, he nearly fell off" in surprise. He gave a shout and pedalled 
on even faster than before. 

On they all went, and on, Bruiny galloping like a horse, and growling 
" Urrrr ! " every now and again. Soon they were just behind the gnome. 
Bruiny snapped at the bicycle wheel. 

The gnome gave a scream and pedalled on 
faster than ever. He turned into a field-path. 
Bruiny went after him. Down the path cycled 
the gnome at top speed, but, oh, my goodness 
me, that path only led to the river ! 

The gnome couldn't stop in time. He 
cycled straight into the water, splash! He 
dropped the bag of gold just as he fell. The 
bicycle went into the river too. 

Bruiny pulled up just in time. Jack nearly 
shot over his head into the water too, but he 
caught hold of the string that made Bruiny 
growl, and just saved himself. Straight into the water. 





They picked up their gold. 

" I do so 



GOOD GRACIOUS, BRUINY 

" Urrrrrrrr ! ' ' said Bruiny. The two 
brownies scrambled off and picked up their 
bag of gold. They looked at the gnome in the 
water. 

" He can swim all right," they said. " My 
word, this is a good punishment for him ! He 
will be wet through, and he will lose his 
bicycle! Serve him right, the wicked little 
robber! " 

" Urrrrrrr! " said Bruiny. " Serve him 
right! " 

Off they went on Bruiny's back again, but 
not so fast. When they got to the lane Jack 
was very sorry. It had been such a thrilling 
adventure. 

" Must Bruiny go back on his wheels again ?" he asked, 
like him alive." 

" Well, if he stays alive some one will take him to live at the Zoo, as 
sure as his name's Bruiny! " said one of the brownies. " But listen, Jack 
you've been very kind to lend him to us so we'll do something for you. 
When you are alone, rub some of our ointment on to his legs, and 

he'll come alive just for you, for a little 
while." 

" Oh, thank you! " said Jack, taking the 
jar of ointment in delight. " That will be 
lovely." 

Bruiny climbed back to his wheels. He 
became still. He was only a toy again but 
there was a twinkle in his eye that hadn't been 
there before. Ah, Bruiny knew he was to come 
alive many a time again! 

And he does but only when Jack is quite 
alone in the nursery, or out in the wood. It 
Thank you," said Jack. must be fun to have a bear like that, mustn't it?

The Tale of 

Mr. Busybody 





MISTER BUSYBODY lived in a small cottage called Bo-Peep in the very 
middle of Dreamy Village. He liked living in the middle of the 
village very much because then he could see all that was going on. 

What a busybody he was! He poked his nose into everything, gave 
advice where it wasn't wanted, and knew everybody's secrets before anyone 
else did. People became very tired of him but Mister Busybody couldn't 
stop poking his nose into things it was such a habit with him. 

But one day something happened that stopped Mister Busybody for 
always. Ah, that was a funny joke, and the folk of Dreamy Village still 
laugh about it when they tell the story. This is what happened on that long- 
ago morning in the quiet village of Dreamy. 

Just opposite Mister Busybody's house was a small field, and now and 
again a fair came to set up swings and roundabouts there. Sometimes a 
gypsy came, who could tell fortunes. Sometimes a passing wizard put up 
his tent there for the night, and did magic tricks for the little folk to 
marvel at. 

Now one night there came to this little field Old Man Jog-About, 
quite a famous magician, who spent his time jogging about the country on 
his little white donkey, showing folks for a penny or two the marvellous 
things he had found on his travels. He set up his yellow and blue tent and 
then sent out notices to say that he had with him the famous red and 
green shoes belonging to the old witch Oddmedodd. Now these shoes 
were very strange. As soon as anyone put them on they at once ran off 
with the person whose feet were inside them! Many a time had the old 
witch Oddmedodd tried this trick on people she wanted to get rid of. 

No one knew how Old Man Jog-About had got the shoes, but every- 
one wanted to see them and touch them. Nobody would dare to try them 

161 



THE TALE OF MR. BUSYBODY 




So that evening scores of the little folk went to see the Shoes. 

on, of course, but it would be most exciting to see the magic shoes that 
had run away with so many people. 

So that evening scores of the little folk went to Old Man Jog-About's 
tent, and paid a penny to see the wonderful shoes. Jog-About's servant, 
little Pipkin, soon had his bag full of pennies, and grinned in delight at 
his master. 

Mister Busybody paid his penny like the rest and heard it clink into 
Pipkin's leather bag. He gaped at the famous shoes, bright red and yellow, 
laced with green thongs. They were pointed shoes, with no heels, and 
looked rather small. Mister Busybody touched them and felt how soft 
yet strong, the leather was. 

162 



THE TALE OF MR. BUSYBODY 

To think that they had once belonged to the old bad witch, Oddme- 
dodd! Dear, dear, dear! 

Mister Busybody went back home that night and dreamed all about 
the shoes. He got up the next morning still thinking about them, and he 
wondered where Old Man Jog- About kept them when he wasn't showing 
them to people. 

" He ought to keep them somewhere safe," thought Busybody. " He 
ought to have a big wooden box for them with a fine fat key. I don't 
expect he has, though ! Folk are very stupid. I shouldn't be a bit surprised 
if he keeps them in an ordinary shoe-bag! Yes, and one day they'll be 
stolen! " 

Busybody sat down to his breakfast, quite worried about where Jog- 
About kept the magic shoes. He got up from his porridge and treacle 
halfway through his breakfast and went to peep through the curtains at 
the field opposite, where the old magician had his tent. 

Pipkin, the little servant, was outside the tent, cleaning the buttons 
on his tunic and whistling loudly. 

" Dear dear! ' said Busybody, ' what a way to clean buttons! 
Doesn't even take his tunic off! Fancy Old Man Jog-About having a 
servant as lazy as that. And goodness me what's he doing now ? ' 

Mister Busybody stared through the curtains and gaped in astonish- 
ment for Pipkin was cleaning a pair of red and yellow shoes with a dirty 
old duster. 




Thieves, robbers, wake up.' 

163 



THE TALE OF MR. BUSYBODY 



"Why why! He's actually cleaning those magic shoes with a 
dreadfully dirty duster! " said Busybody, in great surprise and disgust. " I 
shall go and tefl Old Man Jog- About what I have seen. Really, he should 
a dirty, lazy servant like that and find a new one. Now I should do 



very wcfl indeed to go about the country with him and take the pennies 
from the people. I am dean, I am hardworking, I am . . ." 

But dear me, it would take too long to tell all the wonderful thing* 
that Busybody thought he was! He went back to his breakfast, but he 
didn't finish it. He grew quite excited at the thought of being Old Man 
Jog-About*s servant. How grand it would be to travel with a famous 
magician! How pleased he would be with a fine fellow like Busybody, 
and perhaps he would share all the money with him then Busybody would 
be rich, a thing he had never been in all his life. 



He couldn't wait to finish his breakfast. He clapped his pointed red 
hat on his head and hurried out of his front door. He crossed the road 
and saw that Pipkin was no longer in front of the tent. From inside came 
the sound of snores. Old Man Jog-About was still sound asleep. What 
was Pipkin doing? 

Mister Busybody fek quite sure that the little servant was doing 
something wrong. He heard him whistling softly behind the tent, and he 
crept round to peep at him. 

And oh, my goodness, what a shock Mister Busybody got! For 
Pipkin was putting on the magic shoes ! Yes, before Busybody's very eyes 
he was slipping on a pair of bright red and yellow shoes, laced with green 
thongs! 

" He's going to steal rVm ! " thought Busybody with horror. "There ! 
Didn't I think he was a good-for-nothing servant! Just as Old Man 
Jog-About is peacefully asleep off goes Pipkin the servant and I'm sure 
hell take all the monev too! " 

j + 

Sure enough, just at that very moment there came the sound of 
rhfnking and clinking, and Busybody saw the little servant tying the 
leather bag of money to the belt at his waist. 

Busybody stared as if he couldn't believe his eyes. Pipkin took up a 
stick and set off round the tent, going at a good pace, whistling as he went. 
Busybody wondered what to do. Should he go after Pipkin? Should 
he wake up Jog-About? He would do both! 

164 



THE TALE OF MR. BUSYBODY 

So he ran into the tent, leapt on to Old Man Jog-About's bed, shook 

and bawled loudly into his ear: 

"THIEVES! ROBBERS! WAKE UP! " 

Old Man Jog- About woke with a fearful jump and sat up in bed, his 
night-cap falling off his big white-haired head. He stared at Busybody 
in the greatest surprise. 

" Get off my bed," he said, angrily. " What's the matter? Hie, 
Pipkin, Pipkin, come and throw this fellow out! ' 

" Pipkin's gone," said Busybody. " Ha, he's a bad fellow, that 
servant of yours dirty, lazy, dishonest and now he's gone off with the 
magic shoes and all your money! ' 

" Stuff and nonsense! " said Old Man Jog- About, putting on his 
night-cap again and glaring at Busybody. 

* I tell you it's true! " said Busybody. ' ( I saw him with my own 
eyes, the rascal ! He's gone off down the road, and I'm going after him ! 
I'll soon bring back your money for you, and the shoes too! I'm a fine 
fellow, I am! " 

"Fiddlesticks and rubbish! " 
said Old Man Jog- About, and he 
looked so fierce that Busybody was 
quite alarmed for a moment. 

" Now don't you get upset," 
said Busybody pushing Jog- About 
back on his bed. " Til see to every- 
thing! " 

Busybody ran to the door, 
turned back to nod and smile at 
Jog- About and then set off down f \ 
the street. Jog- About leapt out of ^^ 
bed and went to the opening of 
his tent. He shouted after Busy- 
body. 

4 Come back, you interfering 
fellow! Pipkin's all right! He 
wouldn't steal a thing from me! 

Stop, give me that money and those 

Come back, I say! ' shoes." 




THE TALE OF MR. BUSYBODY 

Busybody heard the shouting and turned for a moment to wave 
his hand. 

" Don't worry, I'll catch him if it takes me all day! " he yelled. 
He looked for Pipkin and saw him far away in the distance. Busybody 
was a good runner, and he thought he would soon be able to catch up the 
little servant. But he had forgotten that Pipkin was wearing magic shoes. 
The witch-shoes took the servant along at a fine pace and Busybody was 
soon puffing and panting. He stopped once to cut himself a thick stick 
from the hedge, for he thought that when he did catch up with Pipkin there 
might be a fight. So it would be as well to have a strong stick. 

Then on he went down the long, dusty country road, and as he drew 
near to Pipkin he began to yell and shout at the top of his voice: 

"STOP! GIVE ME THAT MONEY AND THOSE SHOES! 
STOP ! " 

Pipkin heard the shouting and turned to see what it was. When he 
saw Busybody racing behind him, shouting and waving a stout stick, he 

was most alarmed. 

"A thief! " he said to him- 
self. " A robber ! Oh my, oh my, 
hurry, witch-shoes, and take me 
away from him, for I am only a 
small fellow, and the robber yon- 
der is large." 

The shoes hurried him on and 
soon Pipkin had turned a corner 
and was out of sight. He went on 
to Feefo Town, and made his way 
to a big old house at the end. 
Here Witch Curious lived, and 
Pipkin banged at her door. The 
old dame opened it, and smiled at 
Pipkin, pleased to see him. 

" A pound of peacock 
feathers, please, for my master, 
Old Man Jog-About," said Pip- 
kin. Witch Curious went indoors

She gave him the soundest smacking he 
had had. 



166 



THE TALE OF MR. BUSYBODY 

with Pipkin and weighed out a pound of beautiful blue-green peacock 
feathers. She put them into a bag, and Pipkin counted out the money for 
them. Then he threw the bag over his shoulder and went to the door. 

" If you should see a thief in a curious red hat, and he should ask 
where I've gone, give him a drubbing for me ! " said Pipkin, and he told 
the witch how someone had chased him that morning and frightened him. 

Then he said good-bye and went on his way. Not long after he had 
gone Mister Busybody came panting up. He asked a small pixie if he had 
seen a little fellow in red and yellow shoes, and the pixie nodded his head. 

" Yes, he went to Witch Curious," he said. " I saw him." He 
pointed to her house, and Mister Busybody hurried on. 

" I've no doubt the little rascal went there to sell the magic shoes," he 
thought. He banged at the witch's door and the witch herself opened it. 
As soon as she saw Busybody she remembered what Pipkin had said, and 
she caught hold of him at once. She took off her slipper and gave the sur- 
prised little man the soundest smacking he had ever had! 

" Smick-smack, smick-smack! " went the leather slipper, and Busy- 
body howled dolefully. He wriggled away, rushed down the garden path 
yelling and went along the road, feeling very angry. Soon he met a brownie 
and he asked him if he had seen a little fellow in red and yellow shoes. 

" Yes, he took the road to Tick-Tock Village," said the brownie. So 
Busybody hurried on, quite determined to catch Pipkin if he walked all day ! 

Pipkin was in Tick-Tock Village. It was a strange place, for everyone 
there made clocks, so all day long you could hear the ticking, striking and 
chiming of clocks. 

" Tick-tock, tick-tock," went the clocks as Pipkin walked into the 
village. Just as he got there he looked round and saw to his horror, the 
figure of Busybody hurrying along in the distance. 

" That horrid robber again! " thought Pipkin. " Oh dear! Well, I'd 
better do my business in Tick-Tock Village as quickly as I can, and get away." 

So he went to the head man's house and spoke to him quickly. 

" Please will you send a red chiming clock to Old Man Jog- About 
on Tuesday of next week? Thank you. And oh, I say, if a nasty fellow in a 
curious red hat comes your way, throw him into the pond, will you? 
He's a robber and I'm sure he's after my money! ' 

Off he went, and the head man of Tick-Tock Village watched 



THE TALE OF MR. BUSYBODY 



c- 




Splash, he fell right into the middle. 



Busybody coming nearer. " So 
he's a robber, is he? " thought the 
head man. " Hie, folks ! Come 
round ! Do you see that fellow in 
the curious red hat? Pipkin says 
he's a robber. We'll throw him 
into the pond! " 

So, as soon as Busybody got 
to the village and was asking 
politely if anyone had seen a little 
fellow with red and yellow shoes 
going by, he got the surprise of 
his life. For six of the Tick-Tock 
folk rushed at him, lifted him up, 
took him to the round village 
pond and threw him straight into 
it! 

Splash! He fell right into the 
middle, sank down under the 
water, swallowed two mouthfuls 



and 



came up again, very angry and rather frightened. 

" Get out of our village at once or we'll throw you in again! ' 
shouted the head man. " We don't want robbers here ! ' 

He looked so fierce that Busybody didn't like to say anything at all, but 
hurried off, his wet clothes steaming in the hot sun. Aha! Just wait till 
he caught Pipkin! Wouldn't he give him a sound beating! 

Pipkin was far away in the distance. He had gone to a small cottage set 
high up on a hill. In it lived two dwarfs, Twiddle and Twaddle, both bad- 
tempered and very hard of hearing. Pipkin didn't like them, but Old Man 
Jog-About often did business with them, and Pipkin took messages to 
their cottage about once a week. He knocked on the door and Twiddle 
opened it with a scowl. 

:t Good morning," said Pipkin, politely, at the top of his voice, for 
Twiddle was very deaf indeed. " My master Jog- About, has sent me to 
ask you to gather him some white moly-flower by moonlight next month. 
He will pay you well for it." 

168 



THE TALE OF MR. BUSYBODY 

" Tell him we will," said Twiddle, and he was just going to shut the 
door when Pipkin, turning to go, caught sight of Busybody at the bottom 
of the hill. Busybody had seen Pipkin going up the hill and was following 
him as fast as he could. Pipkin was frightened. He turned to Twiddle. 

"PLEASE let me come in and go out by the back way! " he begged. 
" That's a robber there, coming up the hill. He wants my money and these 
magic shoes. I'm afraid of him." 

Twiddle opened the door wide without a word and Pipkin rushed 
through, went to the back door, opened it and skipped off down the other 
side of the hill, pleased to have given Busybody the slip. 

Busybody walked quickly up the hill, panting, and knocked at the 
door of the cottage. Twiddle opened it and scowled at him. 
" Is there a fellow called Pipkin here? " asked Busybody. 
" Nobody bellows here," said Twiddle, who couldn't hear properly 
what Busybody said. '' Hie, Twaddle, come and help." 

Before Busybody knew what was happening another frowning dwarf 
appeared and the two of them caught hold of him roughly. 

"HE'S A THIEF! " said Twiddle to Twaddle. "INTO THE 
NETTLES WITH HIM! " 

Then, to Busybody's great astonishment and fright the two of them 
swung him forward, threw him up into the air, and crash! He landed on 
hands and knees in a thick bed of nettles that were growing by the side of 

the house. 

Ooh! How they stung! Busybody gave 
a howl and crawled out, being stung by fresh 
nettles all the time. His face, his knees and his 
hands were badly stung, and big tears came 
to his eyes. 

" How horrible people are to-day, to be 
sure," said poor Busybody. " I shall go home. 
I shan't bother about following that robber of 
a Pipkin any more. Old Man Jog-About can 
lose his shoes and all his money too, for all 




So he went sadly down the hill and began 
They threw him up into the air. to make his way home and to his great 

169 



THE TALE OF MR. BUSYBODY 

astonishment who should he see in front of him but Pipkin himself, also 
going back on the road home, whistling merrily! 

It so happened that Pipkin looked behind him, and when he saw Busy- 
body coming down the road too, he stopped his merry whistling and began 
to run as fast as he could. 

" This robber is a dreadful fellow! " he said to himself. " He has 
followed me all the morning and I can V get rid of him ! Oh my, oh my, 
I'd better get back to Old Man Jog-About as quickly as I can." 

He raced back as fast as he could, and Busybody, seeing him run, 
began to run too, hopeful of catching him up at last. 

On they ran, the two of them, on and on and on. The magic shoes 
that Pipkin had on helped him and he ran faster than Busybody. Soon he 
was out of sight, and at last he reached Jog-About's tent and rushed inside. 

" Now, now, what's all the hurry? r> asked Jog- About, startled. 
" Need you come into my tent like an earth-quake, Pipkin? Where are 
your manners, fellow? ' 

" Oh, sir, pardon me," panted Pipkin. " But all the morning I have 
been followed by a robber, a horrid fellow in a curious red hat. He has 
shouted at me and waved his stick at me, and I have been afraid he was 
going to rob me of these magic shoes and all your money." 

" Well, well, well," said Jog- About, remembering how Busybody 



had waked him so suddenly that morning. 
Hark! Here he comes! ' 

Sure enough, there came the sound of 
running feet and Busybody burst into the tent. 
Pipkin at once dived under the table and sat 
there trembling. Busybody looked at Jog- 
About, who was frowning angrily. 

:< How dare you burst into my tent like 
that? " he roared. " That's twice to-day you've 
done it! You're a robber, I hear, a nasty, 
shouting thief! Well, Til teach you to burst 
into my tent and chase my servant! Til . . ." 

" Listen to me," said Busybody. " This 
morning I saw Pipkin, your servant, put on 
those magic shoes you have, and, taking all 

170 



The fellow must be mad. 




S.1 



He ran back home. 



THE TALE OF MR. BUSYBODY 

your money, run off with it. I have chased him all day long for you. If 
he does not return, will you let me be your servant? " 

Jog- About stared at Busybody in surprise, as he told his story. Then 
he began to laugh. How he laughed ! He laughed so loudly that the folk 
of Dreamy Village came round to see what was the matter. They peeped 
in at the tent, staring in surprise. 

" Oh, you silly fellow! Oh, you interfering busybody! " laughed the 
old magician. ' :< So you thought poor little Pipkin was a thief, and had run 
off in my magic shoes with all my money? No no he's my nephew and 
an honester fellow never lived! I told him to put on the magic shoes 
to-day, to take all my messages and do my shopping, for they take him 
faster than his own small feet. As for the money, he needed it to buy 
peacock feathers for me." 

" But where is he, then? " said Busybody. " He hasn't come back, 
has he? That shows he is a robber! ' 

Pipkin crawled out from beneath the table and grinned at Busybody. 
" Here I am! " he said. " Ho ho! I've heard of you, Mister Busybody! 
For once in a way, you've been too busy ! Ha ha ! Who's walked and run 
for miles to-day, all for nothing? Who's had a sound drubbing from 
Witch Curious? Who's been flung into a pond? Who's been pitched into 
a bed of stinging nettles? Ho ho ho! ' 

Busybody grew very red. All the folk of Dreamy Village, who were 
listening by the tent, joined in the laughter. 

" Ha ha! Ho ho! Busybody's been too busy at last! What a joke! " 

Busybody grew redder and redder. So he had rushed about all day for 
nothing ! Pipkin wasn't a thief after all. Why, oh why, had he tried to 
interfere? It wasn't his business. Oh what a great big silly he had been! 

He ran back home, sore with his smacking, wet with his ducking, and 
smarting from nettle-stings. Never, never again would he poke his nose 
into other people's business! 

Mister Busybody still lives in Dreamy Village but he isn't a busybody 
any more. He has changed his name, too, so if you should ever want to 
see him, don't ask for Mister Busybody. Ask for Mister Mind-Your- 
Own-Business! 




The Rat, The Dormouse and 
The Robin 

THERE was once a wicked rat who went about causing sadness and 
misery, and thought himself the cleverest animal in the world. 

But he got caught in a trap ! It was a cage-trap, and had an opening 
at one end. Inside the trap was a strong-smelling kipper. The rat sniffed 
round the trap and could not see how it might catch him. " If I go in at 
that door I can also go out of it," he thought to himself. " So here goes! 
I'll eat that kipper up in no time." 

He slipped in at the open end but no sooner did he pull at the 
kipper than the hook it was on jerked a little rod, and the rod neatly shut 
a door down at the open end ! The rat was caught ! He flashed round in a 
moment to try and get out but it was too late. 

He ran round and round the cage like a mad thing. To think that he, 
the cleverest rat in all the world, should be caught in a silly cage like this ! 
He made such a noise that he woke up a dormouse who was sleeping in 
a hole near by. 

c What's the matter? " asked the dormouse in astonishment, staring 
at the angry rat running round his cage. 

" Matter enough! " said the rat. " Here am I in this cage and cannot 
get out ! And oh, dormouse, my wife is ill, and my little ones are hungry. 
It is a sad, sad thing." 

Now the rat had long ago run away from his wife, and he had eaten 
his own little ones. But he hoped to make the dormouse feel so sorry for 

172 



THE RAT, THE DORMOUSE AND THE ROBIN 

him that he would open the cage. The dormouse was a kind-hearted little 
creature, and almost wept to hear the rat's story. 

" If only I knew the way to free you, I would do so," said the dor- 
mouse. " I do feel so sorry for your hungry little ones." 

" You are very kind," said the rat, grinning to himself. " If you 
would just lift up that rod there, I think I could force open the gate 
myself." 

" Well," said the dormouse doubtfully, " if I do set you free, rat, will 
you promise not to catch me? You have eaten dormice before, I know." 

" Never, never ! " cried the untruthful rat. " I would not touch such 
a kind little thing as you, dormouse. Just lift up the rod, there's a good 
creature." 

The dormouse believed the rat and lifted up the rod. The door swung 
free and the rat pushed it open. In a trice he pounced on the frightened 
dormouse and held him fast. 

" A good dinner for me ! " he squealed. The dormouse squeaked and 
struggled, but it was no use. The wicked rat held him tightly. 

" You are a cruel, hateful creature," cried the dormouse. " You show 
no kindness even to one who saved your life. Help! Help! ' 

The dormouse had a friend, a black-eyed robin. He was in the bushes 
and he flew down when he heard his friend squeaking. " Tirry-lee! " he 
cried to the rat. " What are you doing? ' 

The rat looked up and grinned. " Ah," he said, " I've been very 
clever, robin. I was caught in that trap but now I'm out, as you see, and 
I've caught the dormouse, who let me out of the trap." 

" Wait, wait ! " said the robin, as if puzzled. " I can't follow all that. 
You say the dormouse was in the trap, and you ..." 

" No, I was in the trap, and the dormouse came along ..." said the rat. 

" I see and so you opened the cage and let out the dormouse," sang 
the robin. 

The rat frowned angrily. " Can't you listen to what people say to 
you, robin? I said I was in the trap. ..." 

" I was in the trap," repeated the robin. 

" No, no, not you, I," squealed the rat. 

" And you came along and let me out and then caught the dormouse ! " 
sang the robin merrily. " I see, I see, I see ! ' 

173 



THE RAT, THE DORMOUSE AND THE ROBIN 




" You don't see at all ! " cried the rat. " You weren't in the trap at 
all, and you know you weren't. And how could I let you out if I was in 
the trap? " 

" Well, if you were not in the trap, who was then? " asked the robin 
slyly. 

The rat grew angrier and angrier. " As you are so foolish, robin, I 
will show you what happened! " he said. ;< Now, hold the dormouse for 
me a moment. That's right. Now see I was in the trap like this . . . 
and . . ." 

Click! The robin leant forward and jerked the rod. The door fell 
shut. The rat flashed round at once. The robin nodded his head at him. 
:c Go on, go on," he said. " You were in the trap and the door shut . . . 
what happened next? ' 

' The dormouse came along and opened the trap," said the rat. ' e I'll 
show you now where's that dormouse? You said you would hold him 
for me." 

" No, I didn't," said the robin, flicking his tail cheekily. 



THE RAT, THE DORMOUSE AND THE ROBIN 

" I can't show you if the dormouse doesn't come," said the rat in a 
rage, and he shook the cage with his paws. " You come and lift up this 
rod as the dormouse did, and I'll show you how I got out." 

' Yes and you would show me how you caught the poor dormouse 
and you would catch me instead ! " carolled the robin. " No thank you, 
dear, clever rat! ' 

And off went the robin to visit his friend the dormouse, to tell him 
what had happened. How the two friends chuckled when they thought 
of the rat in the trap once more ! 

He stayed there till the next day, and then the farmer found him. 
That was the end of Mister Rat, and nobody was sorry. Cruelty and 
wickedness are no use in the world, are they! 




Click ! The robin leant forward and jerked the rod. The door fell shut.

Little Mr. Woffles 

BESSIE and Tom were playing ball as they went along through the 
wood. They had been to take some eggs to Mrs. Brown, and now 
they were going home to dinner. They threw the ball from one to the 
other, and tried to see how many times they could catch it without 
dropping. 

Suddenly Bessie threw rather a high ball and it hit a tree-trunk, 
bounced up in the air, fell against a branch and disappeared into the 
middle of the tree. 

" Bother! " cried Tom. " Now it's fallen down a hollow tree. You 
are a silly, Bessie! ' 

" Sorry! " said Bessie. " But can't you climb up and get the ball, 
Tom? I expect it's quite easy to reach if you can climb up to that first 
branch there." 

Tom climbed up, but the branch swung down and he was afraid it 
would break with his heavy weight. 



LITTLE MR. WOFFLES 

" I'm much lighter than you ! " called Bessie. " Come down, Tom, 
and let me climb up! I'm good at climbing." 

So down Tom came and pushed Bessie up on the branch. She swung 
herself up it and came to the tree-trunk. She looked down and saw that 
the tree was hollow inside. The ball rested on a little ledge of bark just 
inside the tree. Bessie was sure she could reach it. She swung her legs 
down into the middle of the tree, and groped about for the ball. 

Then, to her great surprise, she heard a cross voice say: " Who's 
this? What are you kicking me on the head for? ' 

Bessie was so astonished that she lost her balance and fell right into 
the tree. Tom saw her fall and cried out to her. 

" Bessie! Have you hurt yourself? ' 

But there was no answer. No answer at all! Tom was frightened 
and shouted again. 

" Bessie! Are you hurt? " 

Nobody answered. Tom listened, and the only thing he thought he 
heard was something that sounded rather like a far-away chuckle. But 
who could be laughing? 

" I must climb up and see what has happened to Bessie," he thought. So 
up he went. He climbed carefully along the branch, hoping it wouldn't break. 
It held him and he came to the hollow trunk. He peeped down, expecting 
to see Bessie there but the tree was empty! Nobody was there at all. 

" Well, what's happened? " said Tom, in astonishment and alarm. 
" Bessie slipped down there and now she's gone! There's no way out 
of the tree except above, and I know she didn't climb up again. Wherever 
can she be? ' : 

There was nothing for it but to climb down into the hollow tree 
himself. It was a big tree, and there was plenty of room inside it. Tom 
slipped down and felt round it. To his great surprise he found a little bench 
set all round the tree ! Then he saw a tiny cupboard high up, and found a 
little flap against the trunk, which, when set up, made a tiny table! 

" Goodness ! " said Tom, in surprise. " Someone has been using this 
tree as a house to live in! I wonder who it was! And have they taken 
Bessie away? If they have, I must follow her and rescue her. But where 
can she have gone? ' : 

He looked everywhere in the tree but he couldn't find a door of any 



LITTLE MR. WOFFLES 




He darted to the bed and caught hold of a leg. 

sort. At last he looked down at his feet. There he saw what might be a 
little trap-door. He pulled at it and it opened up. Below he saw a flight 
of steps going down into the earth. 

" Well! " said Tom, more and more astonished. " Of all the strange 
things! I'll go down." 

So down he went into the darkness. He had to feel his way along, 
for it really was pitch dark. Then he suddenly remembered that he had 
his little torch in his pocket, so he took it out and switched it on. Good ! 
Now he could see where he was going! 

The steps went down for a long way. Then at last he came to level 
ground. The passage was narrow and winding. Soon it opened out and 
then came to a stop before two doors. Each door had a brass plate on it and 
by the light of his torch Tom read the names. 

One brass plate shone very brightly, and the name on it said " Mr. 
WOFFLES." The other plate was not quite so shiny, and said " Mr. 
GREENEYES GOBLIN." 

*79 



IITTLE MR. WOFFLES 

Tom knocked at the door belonging to Mr. Woffles. A voice cried 
out at once. 

"Go away! Not to-day thank you ! No lettuces wanted. No radishes 
required! ' 

" I'm not selling anything ! " called Tom. 

" Then go away! " said the voice. 

So Tom knocked at the next door, Mr. Greeneyes the Goblin's door. 
No answer came. He knocked again. Still no answer. Tom opened the 
door a little way and peeped inside. Nobody was there at all. There was a 
small round room inside, very untidy. A lamp hung from the ceiling and 
gave a dim light. 

Suddenly Tom saw something blue on the floor and he picked it up 
at once. He knew what it was Bessie's little handkerchief! It had blue 
butterflies worked all over it. So Bessie had been in Mr. Greeneyes 
Goblin's room! But where was she now? There was no door out of the 
room except the one that Tom had come in by. Where could Bessie be? 

" Well, perhaps Bessie and Greeneyes the Goblin are in Mr. Woffles' 
room," he thought at last. " That's about the only place they can be! ' 

So he knocked once more on Mr. Woffles' door. 

" Not to-day thank you! " came the voice again. 

But Tom was not going to be put off any longer. He flung open the 
door and marched in. He quite expected to see two or three goblins 
there, holding Bessie prisoner, so he marched in with a fierce glare, and 
stamped his feet loudly. 

" Ooh! Ooh! " squeaked a voice and Tom saw something dive under 
a little bed standing in the corner of the room. He darted to the bed and 
caught hold of a leg. He pulled out the owner and to his great surprise 
found that he was holding a small, shivering brown rabbit, whose nose 
woffled up and down in terror. 

The rabbit was dressed in blue trousers and a yellow coat and on his 
nose were very big glasses that shook as his nose woffled. He was very, 
very frightened. 

" Ooh! " he kept saying. " Ooh! " 

" Why, it's a rabbit ! " said Tom, astonished. " Where's Mr. Woffles? " 

" Ooh! " shivered the rabbit. " Ooh! I'm M-M-Mr. W-W-Woffles. 
Let me go. I haven't done any harm." 

1 80 



LITTLE MR. WOFFLES 

" I won't hurt you," said Tom, who was a kind-hearted boy, and very 
fond of rabbits. " I just want to know if you have seen Greeneyes and my 
sister." 

" Ooh! " said the rabbit, with a squeak, sitting down in a small rock- 
ing chair. "I haven't seen Greeneyes to-day, and I don't want to. Nasty, 
bad-tempered creature! What do you want him for? Are you a friend 
of his ? " 

" No," said Tom. " But I'm sure he's gone off with my sister Bessie, 
and I want to rescue her." 

" Well, I heard someone shouting out * Help ! ' next door," said Mr. 
Woffles, taking off his spectacles and rubbing them well. " I expect he's 
taken her to help his wife mind all their children. He's got fifteen boys 
and girls, all green-eyed little goblins like himself, and his wife is always 
asking him to get a nursemaid for her, but he can't. So I expect he's taken 
your sister." 

" But there's nobody next door at all," said Tom puzzled. " Anyway, 




Up he flew, and held on to his broomstick in delight. 

181 



LITTLE MR. WOFFLES 

I shouldn't have thought fifteen children could have got into that little 
room! ' 

" Oh, that's only his office where he does his work," said Mr. Woffles. 
" He lives at the rainbow's end, a long way from here." 

" How can I get there? " asked Tom. 

" You can't get there if you don't know the way," said Mr. Woffles. 
" Nobody can." 

" But I must go there! " cried Tom. " Poor Bessie! I can't bear to 
think of her alone and frightened among all those goblin children." 

" Well, how will you get there? " asked the rabbit. " There's only one 
person knows the way, and that's Mother Simple, who lives on Puff 
Hill." 

" Would you take me to her? " asked Tom. 

" Certainly, certainly," said Mr. Woffles, suddenly beaming all over 
his furry little face. " I'd be delighted. Come on." 

He pressed a green knob on the wall of his room, and a hole appeared. 
Tom peeped down it. It looked steep, slippery and dark, and was cer- 
tainly not big enough to stand in. 

" Have I got to crawl down there? " he asked. 

" No, no! that's the slippery slide to the foot of Puff Hill," said Mr. 
Woffles. " Come on. Pick up a mat from the floor and we'll slide down. 
It's great fun if you don't knock your head against the roof." 

Mr. Woffles picked up a mat from the floor, put it inside the hole, sat 
on it and gave himself a push off. Away he went down into the darkness, 
and Tom heard him saying " Ooooooooo! " as he went. 

Then it was Tom's turn. He put his mat into the hole and sat down 
on it. He pushed off and down he sped, faster and faster. He did hope he 
wouldn't bang his head against the roof! 

Here and there small candles shone in candlesticks that stuck out from 
the wall. The slippery slide went down and down, faster and faster, and 
Tom quite lost his breath! Then at last his mat began to slow down and 
came to a stop just behind Mr. Woffles, who was getting off his mat. 
Tom's feet stuck into him as his mat stopped. 

;< Careful, careful! " said the rabbit, hopping off quickly. " Come 
on up this passage! ' 

Up they went and came to a door. The rabbit opened it and Tom saw 

182 



LITTLE MR. WOFFLES 

that they were at the bottom of a hill. Nearby stood a row of big 
birch brooms. Mr. Woffles went up to them and took one. He sat 
astride it. 

" Come along! " he called to Tom. " It's too hot to walk all the way 
up Puff Hill. We'll fly! " 

He smacked his broomstick and it rose up in the air. Tom took one 
and did the same thing. Up he flew, and held on to his broomstick in 
delight. But the ride was short, for they were soon at the top of the hill. 
There Tom saw a small cottage, set in a very flowery garden. In it was an 
old woman, watering her roses. 

" Good morning, Mother Simple! " cried Mr. Woffles, landing just 
beside her. 

" Lawks-a-mussy, how you made me jump! " said Mother Simple. 
" What do you want now, you mischievous little rabbit? ' 

" Which is the way to the rainbow's end? " asked Mr. Woffles. 

" Find the beginning of it, climb up, and slide down the other side," 
answered Mother Simple. 

" Well, where's the beginning? " asked Mr. Woffles. 

" Use your eyes ! " said Mother Simple, and she pointed her watering 
can to the left. 

Tom and the rabbit looked, and they saw the shining arch of a rainbow 
halfway down the other side of Puff Hill. They rushed down to it, afraid 
it would disappear. When they got there Tom saw that steps were cut 
in the shimmering rainbow. He felt sure they would not hold him, for 
the rainbow looked such a delicate thing but to his surprise he found that 
although his feet shook the rainbow, it held him quite safely. 

He and Mr. Woffles climbed up and up till they got to the top of the 
rainbow. They were very high up, and Mother Simple's cottage looked 
small and far-away when they looked down. 

" Now for another slide! " said Mr. Woffles, and he sat down on the 
rainbow. " Whoooooooooosh ! ' Away he went at a terrific speed. Tom 
slid down after him. It was great fun. Bump ! The two of them reached 
the bottom and went head-over-heels at once! 

They sat up and looked round. Tom saw a curious house in the dis- 
tance, all higgledy-piggledy, looking as if it might fall down at any 
moment. Playing round it was a crowd of little goblin children, all sizes, 



LITTLE MR. WOFFLES 

with bright green eyes and yellow shining hair. With them was yes, 
really Bessie! Tom was delighted to see her again. 

" Bessie, Bessie ! "he called. " Come to me! I've come to rescue you !" 

" Sh! You silly stupid boy! " said Mr. Worries, fiercely. " Why did 
you shout like that? You've warned the goblin and his wife that we're here 
now. They'll rush off with Bessie before we can get there! ' 

And sure enough, that is just what they did ! As soon as they heard 
Tom's shouts, Mr. Greeneyes and his wife came rushing out of the house. 
They caught hold of Bessie, whistled to the children who ran up at once, 
and all of them bundled into a funny old car standing nearby. It was shaped 
like a swan in front, and Tom wondered however the goblin could see to 
guide it, for the swan's neck rose up just in front of the steering wheel ! 

Clatter-clatter-clank ! Off went the car, and Tom and the rabbit were 
left to stare at it. 

" Now what can we do? " groaned Tom. 

" Come on! Let's catch a train! " said the rabbit, clutching his arm. 
" I can hear one coming." 

" But where are the railway lines? " asked Tom, in surprise. 

" There aren't any," said Mr. Woffles, impatiently. " Look, here 
comes the train! ' 

Tom looked, and to his amazement he saw a large wooden engine 
coming along, dragging behind it a row of red trucks. In the trucks were 
all kinds of little folk and animals. The last truck was empty and Mr. 




Over the lake they went, trying to catch up the swan-shaped car. 

184 



LITTLE MR. WOFFLES 

Woffles ran to it with Tom close behind. They clambered in and sat 
down. 

The engine-driver looked round, and shouted to Mr. Woffles. 

" Where do you want to go? ' 

" Follow Mr. Greeneyes ! ' ' yelled back the rabbit. 

" Right ! " said the engine-driver at once and drove his engine fast 
after the clanking car of the goblin, which was now far away in the distance. 

" But what about all the other passengers? ' asked Tom. " Don't 
they want to go somewhere else? r 

" Oh no," said Mr. Woffles. " They are only out for a ride. They 
never know where the train will go to." 

Things seemed very queer to Tom, and he hoped he would soon be 
able to get Bessie and take her safely back home. The train went on and on, 
bumping about over the stones, and shaking everybody up thoroughly. It 
went faster than the goblin's car and soon everyone began to get excited. 

f We're catching them up ! " they cried to Tom, and a small pixie was 
so excited that he tumbled right out of his truck. The engine-driver 
wouldn't wait for him to get in again, so he was left behind crying bitterly. 

" We're catching them up! " yelled the engine-driver, and he made 
his engine give a most piercing whistle. 

" Oh look, the goblin is driving straight into that lake ! " suddenly 
cried Tom, in alarm, as he watched the car in front rushing straight towards 
a big blue lake. " Oh, dear! Just look at that! They'll all be drowned! " 

But they weren't, for the swan-shaped motor-car simply swam along 
beautifully, and the goblin yelled and made rude faces at them. 

To Tom's surprise, the engine-driver turned his engine towards the 
lake and ran straight into it ! But as the train was wooden, the engine and 
the trucks floated very well, and nobody seemed to mind at all ! Over the 
lake they went, trying to catch up the swan-shaped car. It was really 
very exciting. 

Suddenly the swan-car spread out large white wings and flew up in 
the air ! Then everyone in the train began to groan, for the engine had no 
wings. But a small pixie in the next truck but one climbed hurriedly into 
Tom's truck and took two pairs of wings out of her bag. 

" Let me fix them on you and the rabbit," she said. " They are quite 
strong. You can fly after the swan then." 



LITTLE MR. WOFFLES 




Tom grabbed Bessie by the hand and took her out of her seat. 

In a trice Tom had wings on his back and so had the rabbit. Mr. 
Woffles was so pleased. He had never had wings before. He spread them 
and up in the air he went, as light as a feather. Tom followed him, crying 
out in delight as his wings beat through the air. It was a wonderful feeling. 

The goblin in the flying swan had no idea that Tom and Mr. Woffles 
were flying after him. He didn't see them until Tom's head appeared over 
the edge of the swan. Then he gave a shout of rage and nearly fell out. 
Tom grabbed Bessie by the hand and took her out of her seat. He held her 
in his arms and flew away with her as fast as he could. Mr. Woffles held on 
to her feet in case she was too heavy. She was so surprised. 

The goblin reached out after them, and overturned the swan! Then 
out all the goblins fell, Mr. Greeneyes, Mrs. Greeneyes, and all the fifteen 

1 86 



LITTLE MR. WOFFLES 

children. Splash! They fell into the big lake below, and Mr. Woffles 
chuckled. 

" That's the first bath they've had for a year! " he said. " Do them 
good ! Look at their swan-car, too it's gone flying on without them ! It 
will probably fly to the moon and never come back again. They've lost it ! " 

: * Oh, Tom, I'm so glad you've rescued me," said Bessie. " There was 
a horrid goblin in that hollow tree, and he took me away to a little room. 
He made a door come in the wall, and dragged me through it. He made 
the door vanish afterwards so that if you came after me you wouldn't know 
where I'd gone. He said I was to be nursemaid to his horrid, bad-tempered 
little children! But I knew you would rescue me! ' 

" Of course! " said Tom. " But I say, Bessie, you are getting heavy. 
I'd better fly down to the ground, or you might drop." 

So down he flew and when he sat down for a rest and looked round, 
he saw a most peculiar thing ! He was sitting in the field just outside his 
garden ! They were home ! 

" Isn't that strange! " said Tom, surprised. " I say, what's happening 
to my wings? ' 

His wings gently pulled themselves from his back and flew into the air 
alone. Tom turned to Mr. Woffles to tell him, but just then a dog began 
to bark not far off. Mr. Woffles turned pale and his nose winked up and 
down. 

" A dog! " he said, in a frightened voice. " I must go! Come and 
see me again some time, Tom! ' 

Off he went, and popped down a rabbit-hole in a twinkling. 

" Goodbye and thank you for your help ! " shouted Tom. " I'll call 
on you again soon." 

The two children went home and told their mother all about it. She 
was so surprised to hear of such strange adventures, and promised to go 
with them to the hollow tree. But do you know, when they climbed down 
into the hollow tree again, the trap-door leading to the passage had gone! 
The bench round the tree, the tiny cupboard and the table had gone too. It 
was just like an ordinary tree. 

" So we shall never be able to see dear little Mr. Woffles again! ' 
said Tom. " What a pity! " 

But they may do you never know! 




MISTER CROSSPATCH was, as usual, in a bad temper. He stamped in at 
the park-gates with his newspaper, and looked for an empty seat. 

" Of course! There isn't one! There never is! " said Mister Cross- 
patch, frowning. " I'll go to that one over there. It has only one man 
sitting on it." 

So he went to the seat by the tulips. But he didn't see the brilliant 
tulips standing in rows in the bright sun. No, Mister Crosspatch never 
noticed things like that! He unfolded his newspaper. 

There was a little old man on the other end of the seat, enjoying the 
sunshine and the tulips. Beside him was a paper parcel, and it was easy to 
see that it had sandwiches in it, and perhaps a cake or two. A small brown 
dog sat on the ground below the seat. 

Mister Crosspatch took out a bar of chocolate and began to crunch it. 
The dog smelt the chocolate and got up. He went to Mister Crosspatch 
and put his nose into the man's hand. Mister Crosspatch jerked it away 
at once. 

" Go away! "he shouted. " Go away! Take your nasty cold nose 
away! ' 

The dog growled, and lay down. Crosspatch turned to the little old 
man at the other end of the seat and snapped at him. " Look after that dog 
of yours! " he said. " I don't want him sniffing round me." 

" But he's ..." began the old man in a mild sort of voice. 

;< No excuse, please! " said Crosspatch. " Dogs are a nuisance anyhow, 

188 



OH, MISTER CROSSPATCH! & 

and even more so when people don't look after them. Not a word more, 
please! I want to read! ' 

The old man looked at the tulips and said no more. The dog saw that 
Crosspatch had dropped a bit of chocolate under the seat and he got up 
to get it. He licked it up. 

" Look at that! " cried Crosspatch in a rage. " Licked up that bit 
of chocolate before I could pick it up! ' 

" Well, it's a bad thing to eat things picked up from the ground," 
said the old man. " Probably the dog thought you had dropped the bit 
there for him." 

" I tell you, I won't have your dog worrying me like this ! " roared 
Crosspatch. 

" Well, he's "... began the old man again, but Crosspatch wouldn't 
hear a word. 

" I told you not to make excuses before," he said. " I never listen to 
excuses. Go away, dog! Shoo! ' 

The dog didn't like Crosspatch. He growled. Crosspatch looked 

down at him. 

" What's the matter with 
him? " he said. " He's no right 
to come sniffing after my choco- 
late like this. Hasn't he had any 
breakfast? " 

" I really don't know! " said 
the old man. 

" There! " cried Crosspatch. 
" You don't even know if he's had 
breakfast! You've no right to 
keep a dog and starve it. No 
wonder he comes for my choco- 
late! Go away, dog! I say, go 
away and stop growling at me! ' 
The dog didn't like Cross- 
j patch's loud voice. " Grrrrrr! ' 
he growled, and showed his teeth. 
" I declare, this dog of yours 

189 




He licked up the bit of chocolate. 



OH, MISTER CROSSPATCH 




The dog darted at the dinner and tore the paper off. 

is positively dangerous ! " cried Crosspatch. " Take him away and give him 
some breakfast before he takes a bite out of somebody's leg ! ' 

" Oh, do be quiet," said the old man. 

" Ha! I like that! " said Crosspatch, and he lost his temper altogether. 
He caught up the parcel of dinner and threw it at the dog. " I'll teach you 
to starve your dog ! He can have your dinner ! That'll make you sit up ! ' 

The dog darted at the dinner, tore the paper off at once with his sharp 
teeth and, before the old man could stop him, had gulped it all down! 
The dinner was gone. 

" You shouldn't do a thing like that," said the old man. 

" Bah! " said Crosspatch, thoroughly enjoying himself. " You're a 
poor sort of creature anyway, letting me throw your dinner to the dog ! 
I'd have thrown anyone out of the park-gates if they'd done that to me ! 
Go away, dog, I tell you ! Go away ! What's he coming again for? Go, 
go, go, you tiresome dog ! ' 

" Well, you've just thrown him a very good dinner," said the old 
man. " Perhaps he thinks you'll give him another." 

The dog sniffed eagerly at Mister Crosspatch, and he hit it. It 
growled at him and Crosspatch became frightened. " Take your dog 
away," he said. :< Go on, take it away. Take it right out of the park. 
If you don't, I'll complain to the park-keeper, and then you'll get into 
trouble." 

* Well, complain to him now," said the old man. " Here he comes." 

And sure enough, along came the big park-keeper, tall and burly in 
his uniform. Mister Crosspatch called him. 

190 



OH, MISTER CROSSPATCH! 




Along came the Park-keeper. 

" Hie! " he said. " I want to make a complaint about this man and 
his dog." 

" It isn't my dog/' said the old man. " I kept trying to tell you but 
you wouldn't listen." 

* Then whose dog is it? " cried Crosspatch angrily. 

" It's mine," said the park-keeper. " I had to go and pick up a child 
who had hurt its knee. I left my dog here to guard my dinner, which I left 
on the seat." 

" Your dinner? " said Mister Crosspatch in a small voice. 

"Yes, MY DINNER! " said the park-keeper in a large voice. 
" Where is it? " 

" He threw it to your dog," said the old man. 

191 



OH, MISTER CROSSPATCH 




" And now out of my park you go I 



" Whatever for? " roared the keeper. 

Mister Crosspatch turned pale. 

" The old m-m-man said he d-d-didn't know if the d-d-dog had had 
b-b-breakfast," said Crosspatch. " So I gave him the dinner-packet. I 
thought it was the old m-m-man's dinner." 

" Oh! You thought a poor old man wouldn't dare to make a fuss 
about his dinner! " said the keeper angrily. " And how could he know if 
my dog had had breakfast ? He doesn't live in my dog's kennel, does he ? 
And why should anybody's dinner be thrown to a dog? ' 

" I'm s-s-so s-s-sorry! " stammered Mister Crosspatch, feeling very 
frightened. 

" Oh, you're going to feel much sorrier ! " said the park-keeper. :c I 
know people like you ! Losing their tempers with people older or weaker 
than themselves, shouting at frightened children and old men! Ha! 
You won't do it again in a hurry! Give me a shilling, please. I shall 
have to buy myself a new dinner." 

Crosspatch paid out a shilling at once. 

192 



OH, MISTER CROSSPATCH! 

" And now, out of my park you go ! " roared the keeper. " And mind 
you behave yourself when you come into it next time ! ' 

He took hold of Crosspatch, jerked him up from the seat, and ran him to 
the park-gates. Out went Crosspatch on his nose, and the little dog stood 
over him and barked in delight. The keeper laughed and as for the little 
old man on the seat, well, he hadn't been so amused for a very long time. 

" He'll be careful how he behaves next time," said the keeper. 
" Throwing my dinner to the dog indeed ! I'll be on the watch for him 
next time! ' But Mister Crosspatch won't ever go to that park again. 
He's much too frightened! 

How Clever You Are 




H 



*ERE is a little number-trick, which will puzzle people 
and make them think you are very clever indeed. 
Begin by saying something ridiculous. " I am a mar- 
vellous thought-reader! Did you know that? ' 
" No! What do you mean? " 
" Well, I can tell you any number you think of! " 
" Tell me then." 

" All right. Think of a number ! Have you thought of one? 
Good. Now multiply it by 3. Done it? Good. Now add one. Now 
multiply by 3 again. Now add the number you first thought of. 
Done that? " 

" Yes, I've done it." 

" Now tell me the number you have got to, and I will tell you the 
number you first thought of! ' 

Then your friend will tell you his total number, which mil always 
end in three. Take off the 3, and the number left is the one he thought of. 
Marvellous ! 

Say he thought of the number 5 ; Multiply by 3, which makes 15 ; 
Add one, which makes 16 ; Multiply again by 3, making 48 ; Add the 
number first thought of (5) making 53. Strike off the 3, and you have 
5 which is the number he thought of! Try it out and see how right 
you are every time. Always strike off the right-hand number, and the 
number that is left is the one first thought of.

In the Heart of the Wood 

SCAMP ! Do you want to go for a walk? " shouted Benny. 
Sally, are you coming too? " 

A black scottie flung himself on Benny, and darted round in delight, 
his tail wagging hard. A walk! That was just what he loved! 

Benny's sister came running downstairs, pulling on her coat. " Yes, 
I'm coming, Benny. Let's go to the wood, and watch Scamp chasing the 
rabbits. They both have such fun. The rabbits know he can't catch them, 
but Scamp always hopes he will! ' 

So off went the three of them to the wood. Scamp tore in front, for 
he had heard the magic word " rabbits ". Ah, one day he would catch one, 
he felt certain of it. 

They came to the wood. It was a nice wood, but so deep and dark in 
the middle that the children had never walked right to the heart of it. 

" Woof! " said Scamp, spying a rabbit cocking an ear at him behind a 
tree, and off he went. The rabbit tore off too, its white bobtail going up 
and down. 

It went into a hole. " Scamp always thinks that's not fair! " said 
Sally, with a laugh. Scamp looked up at her. He thought that rabbits 
should live in holes that were big enough for dogs to get down ! 

Another rabbit flashed by. Off went Scamp, and this time he dis- 
appeared behind the trees. The children walked on after him. They 
walked for some time, and didn't see Scamp at all. 

194 



" We'll have to turn back soon," said Benny. " Scamp! Scamp! 
Come along now. Home, boy, home! ' 

Sally whistled. No Scamp came. Bother! Now they would have to 
look for him. 

Into the wood they went, and then heard, in the distance, Scamp's 
excited barks. But he took no notice at all of their calls. They hurried 
towards him, going deeper into the wood than ever before. 

Scamp was chasing a rabbit round a tree or was the rabbit chasing 
him? Sally laughed. Then the rabbit suddenly darted off, ran to the right, 
and disappeared at the foot of another tree. 

But what a tree ! The children stared in wonder at it. They had never 
seen a tree so big before. Scamp ran to it and sniffed about at the bottom, 
where there was a hole into which the rabbit had gone. 

" Let's come and look at that enormous tree," said Sally. " My 
goodness what a size it is round the trunk! ' 

Benny hit it hard, and then looked at Sally, his eyes shining. " It's 
hollow! " he said. " Let's climb up and look down into the hollow. 
Come on! ' 

So into the branches of the big tree they went, up and up. Then they 
looked down into the hollow. The heart of the trunk was empty and 
rotten completely hollow. It was a wonder that the tree was still 
alive ! 

" Let's get down into the hollow, Sally," said Benny. " Do let's! " 

Sally looked down into the tree. " But Benny," she said, " suppose 
we dropped down into the hollow and couldn't climb up again. We'd have 
to stay there for ever. Nobody would hear our calls, you know." 

" We'd better get a rope," said Benny, peering down into the vast 
empty heart of the tree. " Come on. Let's go back and get it now. I feel 
excited ! Why, the inside of that tree is almost big enough to play houses 
in! " 

They climbed down again and rushed home, Scamp following them. 
He felt rather pleased with himself, because it was he who had shown 
them the tree they thought so wonderful! 

They found a long, strong rope in the gardener's shed, and went off 
with it again. Mother called them back. " You can't go off now," she 
said. " It's tea-time." 



IN THE HEART OF THE WOOD 




The heart of the trunk was empty and rotten completely hollow. 

" Oh well we'll have tea and go afterwards," said Benny, who 
simply couldn't give up the idea of getting down into the hollow tree as 
soon as possible. 

So after tea off they went. Benny had the rope tied round his waist. 
Scamp tore along in front, looking out for rabbits again. 

" Here's the tree golly, it really is enormous ! " said Benny, and he 
undid the rope round his waist. " Come on, Sally. Up the tree we go." 

And up they went. They came to a good strong branch and Benny 
tied the rope firmly to it. Then he dropped the end down the middle of 
the tree. It fell into the dark hollow below. 

196 



IN THE HEART OF THE WOOD 

" I wish we had a torch," said Sally, peering down. " There might be 
a rat down there, and I don't like rats." 

" I've brought a torch, and there won't be rats," said Benny. " Any- 
way, Scamp will soon send them away if there are." 

" You go first, Benny," said Sally. He swung himself down on the 
rope down and down, hand over hand, his legs twisting together round 
the rope. 

He dropped with a thud into the hollow of the tree. It smelt musty. 

" Come on, Sally," he yelled, feeling for his torch. " My word, it's 
like a small room inside this tree. It's most exciting." 

Sally slid down the rope. She went too fast and her hands felt as if 
they were burning. She landed beside Benny, on to something soft. She 
wondered what it was. 

" Do switch on your torch," she said. " Quick! ' 

Benny switched it on and the light shone around them in the curious 
tree-hollow. And then they noticed something very queer. 

" Look," said Benny, puzzled, " what's that piled here and there? 
Sacks! Empty sacks! And look, here's an empty cardboard box ! Sally 
whatever are they doing here? " 

" Somebody has been using this tree for something! " said Sally. 
"Oh Benny whose tree is it! We'd better find out! " 

" You know, Sally, I think someone is using this hollow tree to hide 
things in," said Benny. " Maybe a robber! ' 

" Gracious ! " said Sally, scared. " Do you mean a burglar, perhaps. 
There have been an awful lot of robberies lately, haven't there? And the 
police have never found any of the stolen goods." 

" I say I hope whoever uses this tree as a hiding-place doesn't come 
whilst we're here," said Benny, suddenly feeling uncomfortable. 

" Well, Scamp is outside the tree. I can hear him snuffling round," 
said Sally. " He'd scare away any robbers ! ' 

Scamp was scraping hard at a hole at the bottom of the hollow tree. 
Benny flashed his torch downwards and laughed. " Look he's got his 
head inside the tree but he can't get his body through. Poor old Scamp ! 
Mind you don't get stuck! ' 

" Let's look at these sacks and see if they tell us anything," said 
Sally. " There are so many of them all empty too ! ' 



IN THE HEART OF THE WOOD 



" Wait a bit here's one with something in! " said Benny, and he 

picked it up. He opened the neck of the sack and flashed his torch inside. 

" Sally, look what's that gleaming inside there? " he said. " Pull 



it out/ 3 



Sally put in her hand and tugged. Out came a beautiful silver candle- 
stick, with branching ends for candles. " Well ! " said Sally. " Look at 
that! This is a hiding-place for stolen goods! ' 

Scamp suddenly took his head out from the hole in the tree and began 
to bark loudly. Sally felt frightened. 

" Benny! Scamp's barking," she said. " Do you think someone is 
coming? Oh, I do hope it isn't the robbers ! " 

Scamp was barking his head off. " Woof, woof, woof! Woof, woof, 
woof! Grrrrrrrrrr! ' 

" Look at that dog! " said a man's hoarse voice. " What's he doing 
there? Do you think there's anyone about in the wood this evening, 
Bill?" 

" Might be," said another voice, rather low. " Dump the sack in that 
bush over there, Alf where it won't be seen. Then we'll sit down with 
our backs to the hollow tree and wait a bit to see if the owner of the dog 
comes along. Maybe the dog's just rabbiting by himself." 

Sally clutched Benny's hand as they heard this. Men with another 
sack! It must be the robbers! What would they say when they found the 
two children inside the tree! 

" Sh! " said Benny, in Sally's ear. " Don't make a sound, Sally. Per- 
haps Scamp will send them off. Hark how he's barking." 

The two men sat down with their backs against the tree. The children 
sat on the sacks, absolutely still. Scamp went on barking. 

" He's just rabbiting," said one of the men at last. " Chuck a stone 
at him, Alf, and send him off! " 

There was a piteous squeal from Scamp as a large stone struck him. 
Then the sound of scampering feet. " He's gone," said Alf. " Now to get 
to work! " 

The two men got up. Benny felt Sally trembling. How he wished 
their dog Scamp had not run away. Poor Scamp he must have been badly 
hurt by the stone the man threw at him. 

The men began to climb up the tree. The children could hear them 

198 



IN THE HEART OF THE WOOD 




Out came a beautiful silver candlestick. 

quite plainly. Then one of them found the rope that Benny had tied to a 
branch, so that he and Sally might get down easily. 

" Hey look at this ! " said one of the men. " Someone's been here ! 
Our hiding-place is found. Someone's been down in this hollow tree." 

" Did we leave anything there in the sacks? " asked the other man. 
" Yes, we did that silver candlestick we couldn't sell! Wonder if it was 
found. Alf, maybe a watch is being kept on this tree!" 

" Yes. Better get the candlestick quick and go," said Alf, and 
slithered down the rope! 

He landed right on top of poor Benny. The boy gave a yell, and the 
man jumped in alarm. 

" What's up? " called down the other man. 

" Two kids here ! " answered Alf, and he gave the children such a look 
that they shivered. " Two silly stupid interfering kids ! What are we 
going to do with them? ' 

" Ask them what they know," called down Bill. " Maybe no one else 
knows of this tree but them." 

199 



IN THE HEART OF THE WOOD 

"We only found it a little while ago," began Sally, in a trembling 
voice. " Nobody else knows anything about it. Please let us go." 

The men were very angry to think that their hiding-place had been 
found. Alf went up the tree and talked to Bill for a long time. Then he 
called to the children. 

" Look out down there! There's a sack coming. Mind your heads! " 

Benny pushed Sally aside. A sack came down and landed with a 
thud. The children were astonished. Were the men going to go on using 
the tree then? 

" We're coming back at midnight to fetch the things," called down 
Alf. " And you're going to stay down there in the tree, see, so that you 
can't go and tell anyone. If you're good children maybe we'll let you out 
then if you're not we'll leave you down in the hollow! ' 

Sally gave a squeal. " Oh don't leave us here now. It's getting dark. 
Do, do let us go home. We won't say a word." 

The men pulled up the rope that hung down into the hollow. Without

that to help them up the children could not possibly get out of the tree. 
Whatever were they to do? 

The men slithered down the tree and jumped to the ground. The 
children heard them going through the wood. Sally was very frightened. 

" Oh Benny can't we get out? Have we got to stay here till mid- 
night? What will Mother say? " 

" Cheer up. We'll have to stay," said Benny. " Curl up on the sacks, 
Sally, I'll look after you. I expect they'll set us free at midnight! ' 

The two children settled down on the sacks inside the tree. It was very 
dark now. Benny felt worried. He had always been taught to look after his 
sister, and he didn't know how to put things right. How could they escape 
from the hollow tree when their rope was gone? It was quite impossible. 

The children sat there in silence. Benny switched his torch on at 
times, just to cheer them up. He didn't like to leave it on all the time in 
case the battery wore out. He put his arm round Sally. 

" Never mind, Sal," he said. " It's an adventure, you know! " 

"Well, I don't like it," said Sally. " Oh, Benny, I hope those men 
really mil come back. Suppose they left us here for ever? r 

" Silly! " said Benny. " Of course they wouldn't." But all the same 
he felt very anxious too. 

Suddenly there was a rustling sound outside the tree. Sally clutched 
at Benny's hand in fright. Whatever was it now? A robber creeping back? 
A rat? Oh dear! 

There came a curious snuffling sound and then a little whine. Sally 
gave a cry of joy. 

" Scamp! It's old Scamp! Dear old dog, he's come back to find us! ' 

' Woof," said Scamp, cautiously, and stuck his head through the 
hole at the bottom of the tree. He couldn't get any further. He blinked 
up at them. 

:< Scamp, can't you rescue us? " said Benny. ;< No, I don't see how 
you can. Look at that place on his head, Sally that must have been where 
the robber's stone hit him." 

" Poor old boy," said Sally. 

Suddenly Benny gave a cry and made Sally jump. " Sally! Sally, J 
know what we can do ! We can write a note, and tie it to Scamp's collar, 
and send him home with it! Can't we? ' : 

201 



IN THE HEART OF THE WOOD 




Sally clutched at Benny's hand in fright. 

" Oh JKJ," said Sally, joyfully. " Of course. Have you got a bit of 
paper, Benny? I've got a pencil." 

Benny wrote on the paper. " Mother, we are prisoners in a hollow 
tree in the wood. It's a hiding-place for stolen goods. The robbers came 
whilst we were in the tree and they have taken our rope so that we can't 
get out. They are coming back at midnight to get their goods. Please 
rescue us. Scamp will show you where we are, if you follow him. Love 
from Benny and Sally." 

E< Mother will be surprised to get a note like that," said Benny, and 
tied it firmly to the back of Scamp's collar. It stood up plainly. Then he 
rubbed Scamp's nose. 

" Home, old boy," he said. " You go home with that note and find 
Mother. Home, old boy! ' 

Scamp was a clever dog. He understood. He pulled his head from the 
hole, and backed away. Then the children heard his feet pattering through 
the wood. 

" He's gone. Now we'll have to hope Mother sees the note and does 

202 



IN THE HEART OF THE WOOD 




something to save us," said Benny. 
" Cheer up, Sally. Things don't 
look so black after all! ' 

The wood was very dark and 
quiet, except when an owl hooted, 
or some small animal rustled here 
and there. The children sat and 
waited in silence, hidden deep 
inside the old hollow tree. 

Benny looked at his watch. 
" Oh dear it's half-past 
eleven already," he said. " I 
wonder if Mother has found the 
note on Scamp's collar. Surely 
she would have been here by now 
if she had." 

" Sh! I can hear something!" 
whispered Sally. " Oh it's Scamp 
again, surely! And somebody 
with him! " 

It was! The children heard his eager snuffling, and then heard 
many footsteps. Quite a lot of people seemed to be following Scamp. 

" Here's the tree," said their father's voice. " What an enormous one! 
Benny, Sally, are you there? ' 

" Oh yes, Daddy! " cried both children. " We're still here. We 
thought you were never coming. Is Mother there? ' 

" Yes," said their mother's anxious voice. :< I've been so worried 
about you. Listen, we told the police about your note and they are here 
too, planning to catch the robbers. Have they been back again? ' 

" Not yet. They said midnight," said Benny. :t Is that the police we 
can hear all round? ' 

" Yes," said a deep voice. " This is Inspector Jenks here. We're 
going to get you out of that tree first, both of you. Then we're going to 
hide in the bushes round and completely surround the tree, to wait for the 
men to come back. We've got a rope to haul you up. But we'll have to be 
quick about it! ' 

203 



Scamp had a beautiful blue collar. 



IN THE HEART OF THE WOOD 

Someone climbed the tree, and soon after a rope came slithering down 
into the hollow. The children climbed out thankfully, dropped down the 
tree and ran to their parents. Scamp licked their legs from knee to ankle, 
he was so pleased to have them again ! 

" Now you'd better get into the bushes too," said the Inspector. 
" There's no time to take you back home. Not another sound please ! 
Hold the dog, one of you children." 

Then there was silence, whilst everybody waited. Scamp began to 
whine softly. That meant that someone was coming. Benny quietened 
him. " There's someone coming," he whispered to the Inspector, who 
was close by him. 

So there was ! It was the two robbers coming back through the wood 
to the enormous hollow tree. They didn't know anyone was lying in wait. 
They didn't even lower their voices as they came! 

They climbed the tree. They called down to the children who they 
thought were still down in the tree. There was no answer, of course. Then 
down they jumped into the hollow to find no one there! 

The rest was easy. The police moved up and the tree was surrounded. 
The burglars were caught, their goods were taken from them, and they 
were marched away to the police station! 

" Oh, wasn't it exciting ! " said Benny, as he and Sally and Scamp 
went home with their parents. " I did love it! ' 

" Too exciting! " said his mother. " Don't do that sort of thing too 
often, Benny." 

That wasn't quite the end of the story. The police sent Benny and 
Sally a lovely watch each for their help in catching the robbers and Scamp 
had a beautiful blue collar with his name on it. 

But he did deserve it, didn't he?

The Christmas Tree Pi<| 

ONCE there was a sugar pig who was hung up on a Christmas-tree, with 
a great many other toys and ornaments. He was quite happy there 
until the little black doll next to him began to talk. 

:t Hallo, there, sugar pig! You'd better be careful when the candles 
are lighted on this tree. That one just below you will melt you, as sure 
as anything! ' 

The sugar pig looked down below him in alarm. Sure enough, there 
was a green candle just beneath him. Goodness, he would certainly melt 
when that was lighted! 

It was a horrid thought for the little sugar pig. He spoke anxiously 
to the black doll. " Can you reach up and untie the bit of string that binds 
me to this branch? I must get away from this candle." 

The black doll could just reach, and very soon the sugar pig was free. 
He slipped down from branch to branch until he came to the floor. His 
legs were stiff, but he soon managed to make them run. 

" I shall run right away from this horrid place," said the sugar 
pig to himself. So he ran out of the room. But almost at once 
he met the big tabby-cat who lived in the house, and she shot after 
him. 

" Come here, pink mouse ! " she mewed. " I'd like to have you for 
dinner! " 

205 





THE CHRISTMAS TREE PIG 

The sugar pig fled into a 
mouse-hole, and when he was sure 
he was safe he poked his pink snout 
out in a rage. " Hie, you cat! " he 
squeaked, " I'm a pig, not a mouse. 
I'm a pink sugar pig!" 

" Better still!" said the cat, 
and tried to scoop him from the 
hole with her paw. " I love sugar 
animals! ' 

The sugar pig ran down the 
hole and soon came to a bigger 
hole leading into the kitchen. He 
peeped out. No one was about. He 
ran out and looked for a safe place 
to hide. 

But just then Bobby, the 
brown dog, came sniffing into the 
kitchen. He had smelt that sugar 
pig, and had come to find him. He soon saw him and scampered after him. 

" Come here, pink mouse! I'll have you for my dinner! ' 

The sugar pig ran out of the door in a fright. The wind banged the 
door after him and shut the dog into the kitchen. The pig was safe ! How 
pleased he was! 

" The big world seems just as dangerous as the Christmas-tree! " he 
said to himself as he wandered down the garden path. :< Oh ! Ooooh ! 
Eeeeeee! " 

No wonder he squealed! A big blackbird had spied him running 
down the path and had come to peck him, thinking he was a large pink 
caterpillar ! 

" Come here, pink caterpillar! Fd like you for my dinner! " said the 
blackbird. "Peck, peck! " 

He dug two sugary bits out of the poor sugar pig and liked them very 
much. If the sugar pig hadn't run under the hen-house, he would have 
been pecked to bits! 

But, dear me, that is what very nearly did happen to him the minute

after! For the hens found him 
under their house, and how they 
chased him to peck him! 

" Come here, pink spider! " 
they clucked. " We'd like you for 
our dinner! " 

" I'm not a spider, nor a cater- 
pillar, nor a mouse ! " squealed the 
sugar pig. >:c Leave me alone. I'm 
just a little sugar pig! " 

He ran out of the hen-yard and 
hurried down a path. And there 
something nearly ran him over! 
It was a small girl on a tricycle. 
When she saw the pink pig lying on 
his side, all the breath knocked out 



How they chased him. 



of his fat sugary body, she was most surprised. 

She got off her tricycle and picked him up. 
" Why, it's a pink sugar pig," she said. " How 
did you come to be here, sugar pig? ' : 

" Oh, I escaped from a very dangerous 
place, little girl," panted the sugar pig. " And 
first a cat wanted me for her dinner, and I es- 
caped down a mouse-hole. Then a dog wanted 
to eat me, and I ran into the yard. Then a 
blackbird wanted to gobble me up, and I hid 
under the hen-house and then the hens tried 
to peck me to bits. Oh, I tell you I've had a 
very dangerous and worrying time." 

" Poor little sugar pig," said the little 
girl. " I should think you would like to be put 
into some safe place, wouldn't you? " 

" Yes, I would," said the pink pig. 

207 




I 



How did you come to 
be here ? " 



THE CHRISTMAS TREE PIG 

" Well, I'll take you indoors to my mother," said the little girl. " She 
will know what to do with you." 

So she took the sugar pig indoors and told her mother all about him. 

" What a queer story! " said Mother. " I know a very safe place to 
put him, so don't worry, darling." She picked up the little sugar pig and 
took him into another room. And there stood the big Christmas-tree. 

" I'll put him on this tree," said Mother. " He will be quite safe 
there." So she tied him to a branch with a bit of string and left him. 

And will you believe it, when the pink sugar pig looked around him, 
he saw the little black doll nearby and the green candle just below him ! 

" Ho, ho ! " said the black doll. ' So you've come back again, have 
you! Well, well, well! " 

But the sugar pig needn't worry ! Nobody will let the candles burn the 
toys, and he will be quite safe. He had had all his adventures for nothing. 

" I'm back where I started!" squealed the sugar pig. " But here I'm 
staying now, so don't you say another word to me, black doll! ' 

And there he is still, unless the children have had the Christmas-tree. 
Where do you suppose he will be if they have had it? 





ONCE upon a time there was a big toy duck who sat on a shelf in 
the toyshop, and was never sold. 

He had been pushe4 behind a big box, and no one knew he was there. 

He was really a fine duck. He was made of celluloid, and if only he had 
been put into a bath full of water then you would have seen how beautifully 
he could float ! But ever since he had been in the shop he had sat up on the 
dark shelf and had never moved from there he did not even know that he 
could float! 

He had no legs, so he could not get up and walk about at night as the 
other toys did. All he could do was to poke his big orange beak out from 
behind the box, and watch the other toys dancing, shouting and playing 
together on the floor below. 

So you can guess he led a very dull life and was always longing for a 
little excitement, which never came. 

And then one day a doll with a barrow was put up on the shelf near 
the duck ! The wheel of the barrow had broken, so the doll could not be 
sold. It went by clockwork and when it was wound up it walked along, 
holding the barrow and pushing it. It was lovely to watch it. But now 
that the wheel was broken, the doll was no use either. 

" Hallo ! " said the duck, in great surprise. " I haven't seen anyone up 
on this shelf for years ! How did you get here? ' 

" I've been put up here out of the way," said the doll sadly. " I expect 
I shall be here for years, too, getting older and dustier each day! ' 

" I am dusty too," said the duck. " You would not think that my back 
was really a bright blue, green and red, would you? Well, it is ! But there 

209 



RAIN IN TOYTOWN 

is so much dust on me that I look grey. I have kept my beak a nice bright 
orange by rubbing it against the back of this box. Oh, doll, it is so exciting 
to have someone to talk to! ' 

" Do you suppose everyone will forget about me, as they have for- 
gotten about you? " asked the doll, with tears in her blue eyes. She was 
a dear little doll, dressed in a gardening overall. Her hair was brown and 
curly, and she wore no hat, but a ribbon tied up her curls. Her hands held 
the handles of the barrow tightly. 

" I expect we shall stay here till we fall to pieces," said the duck, with 
a sigh. 

" Well, I don't see why we should ! " said the doll, tossing back her 
hair fiercely. " Surely we can think of a way to escape from this shelf." 

" But where should we go if we did? " said the duck. " You would be 
put back on the shelf, if the shopkeeper found you again, I am sure." 

" If only I could mend my wheel, I could wheel my barrow 
away, and go to Toytown," sighed the doll. " I know the way quite 
well." 

" Let me have a look at the 
wheel," begged the duck. " Per- 
haps I can think of a way of mend- 
ing it! " 

The doll pulled the barrow 
round so that the duck could see it. 
The wheel was broken quite in 
half. There was no mending it, 
that was certain! 

" I believe I know what you 
could do! " said the duck, in ex- 
citement. " Why not take out that 
wheel, and slip in something else 
instead a cotton-reel, for instance. 
That would make a very strong 
wheel! " 

" I didn't think of that ! " cried 
the doll. " Oh, duck, that would be 
just the thing ! To-night I will see 

210 




I believe I know what you can do I 



RAIN IN TOYTOWN 

what I can do ! >:> So that night the doll tried to get out the broken wheel. 
The duck helped her by pecking hard, and at last out came the wheel! 

: ' Good ! " cried the duck. " Now climb down to the work-basket on 
that chair, doll. You are sure to find an empty reel there." 

The doll climbed down. The basket belonged to the shopgirl, and in 
it she had full reels, half-used ones, and two empty ones. The doll chose 
the bigger one of the two, and climbed back to the shelf with it. 
The duck helped her to fit it into 
the barrow and hey presto, she 
could wheel it along beautifully! 
The reel went round and round 
just as well as the wheel had done. 

" And now I shall go to Toy- 
town," said the doll happily, taking 
hold of the handles of the barrow. 

"Well, good-bye," said the 
duck sadly. :< I am glad you are 
able to go, but I am sorry to lose 
you." 

" Oh, but you are coming with 
me! " said the doll, laughing. 

" How can I do that! " cried 
the duck. " I have no legs, and 
cannot walk, and my wings are 
only painted. They will not fly." 

" Ah, but I shall put you into 
my barrow and wheel you along 
with me! " said the kind little doll. 
" You have helped me, duck, and now I will help you. You are not 
heavy, and though you will not fit very well into my barrow, still, I 
think I can manage! ' 

The duck was too excited to answer ! The doll picked him up in her 
arms, for he was very light, though quite big. She put htm on her 
barrow he would not go right in for he was too big but she managed 
to balance him quite well. Then she wheeled him to the end of the 
shelf. 




She wheeled him to the end of the shelf. 



211 



RAIN IN TOYTOWN 

Just below the shelf stood a big dolls' house. The doll cleverly 
wheeled the barrow from the shelf to the roof of the house, then down the 
roof to a balcony that jutted out from a bedroom. Then she called to a 
big teddy bear, and asked him to help her. 

" Will you lift down this duck for me, and my barrow? " she asked. 
" I can quite well climb down myself." 

The big bear was a good-natured fellow, and he lifted down the duck 
gently, and then the barrow. The cotton-reel fell out, and the bear pushed 
it in again. The doll quickly climbed down from the balcony, and put the 
duck in the barrow. They called thank-you and good-bye to the teddy 
bear, and then off they went on the way to Toytown, the doll wheeling 
the duck in the barrow. 

They journeyed for two nights and a day, and at last they came to 
Toytown. At the gates stood a wooden policeman. 

" What do you want in Toytown? " he asked. " It is very full just 
now. Unless you have some work to do, doll and duck, I cannot let you 



in." 



" I'm a gardener doll," said the little doll. " Can't you see my 
barrow and my overall. I'm a very good gardener. I shall soon find 
work to do." 

" But what about the duck? " asked the policeman. " What work 
will he do? " 

" Oh, he'll find something ! " said the doll. " Do let me in, please, for 
I am very tired." 

So, grumbling a little, the toy policeman let them go through the 
gates, and the wheelbarrow rumbled down the neat streets of Toytown. 
Dolls' houses stood on every side, and toy shops sold their wares. Little 
farms, with wooden animals and trees were here and there. The doll 
stopped at the gate of one. 

" I think I'll go in and ask the farmer here if he will let me be his 
gardener," said the doll. " I can see one or two trees that have fallen over. 
I can do a good many jobs here! And I believe I can see a pond that you 
could float on! ' 

So she wheeled her barrow, and the duck as well, through the farm 
gate and went up to the farmer. He was made of wood, but he had very 
sharp little eyes. 



212 







RAIN IN TOYTOWN 

" Oh, so you want to be a 
gardener here, do you? " he said. 
" Well, I can do with one. I have 
too much work to do. Can you 
feed the chickens and the ducks 
too, and look after the pigs as 
well? " 

" Oh, yes," said the doll. " I 
can do anything. Will you please 
let the duck in my barrow float on 
your pond till he too finds some 
work to do? ' 

" Very well," said the farmer. 
" Take him over there." 

So the duck was taken to a^ 
small pond and he floated there in . 
great delight. The pond was very 
tiny, and the duck almost filled it 
all. When he floated very hard he 
made big waves at the edge of the pond, and then all the tiny ducks 
nearby quacked with fright. 

The doll set to work. She was a good gardener, and she did her best 
to see to the chickens, ducks and pigs too. She enjoyed working in the 
sunshine, but when it began to rain, and her hair and overall got soaked, 
she did not like it so much. 

" My feet get stuck in the mud," she complained to the duck. " It is 
horrid!" 

The duck liked the rain. For one thing it made his pond bigger, and 
that gave him more room. He liked to feel the raindrops, too but he 
was sorry for the little doll. 

" Have you found me any work to do yet? " he asked the doll. 

" No," said the doll, with a sigh. " It seems very difficult to get work 
for someone who cannot walk or fly. I am worried about you, duck. The 
policeman said yesterday that the little ducklings here had complained 
that you take up all the room on their pond. He said that you will have to 
leave Toytown next week if you cannot get any work." 

213 



The wheelbarrow rumbled down the neat 
streets of Toytown. 



RAIN IN TOYTOWN 

" Oh dear! " said the duck, in dismay. " That means I shall have to 
go back to that horrid shelf for the rest of my life ! ' 

" I don't want you to do that," said the doll, with tears in her eyes. " I 
am so fond of you now. And you do look so beautiful since I cleaned 
you up." 

The duck certainly looked splendid now! The doll had rubbed off all 
the dirt and dust, and his back shone blue, green and red. He was a fine 
sight to see. But what was the use of that if he had to go back to his dark 
shelf again! It was too bad. 

" If only this rain would stop ! " said the doll, squeezing the water 
out of her overall. " I am always wet and always cold now. A-tishoo ! 
A-tishoo! " 

" Oh, don't get a cold! " begged the duck in alarm. " If you have to 
go to bed, what will become of me? The Policeman will turn me out, 
I am sure." 

" A-tishoo ! " sneezed the little doll. " Oh dear, I can't stop sneezing. 
A-tishoo! " 

Well, that very night the doll was put to bed in the farmhouse by the 
farmer's wife, for she really had a shocking cold. The duck swam sadly by 
himself on the pond, keeping a look-out in case the policeman came along. 
And sure enough, he did! The duck saw him wading across the field to 
the pond, looking as black as thunder because he was getting so wet and 
muddy. 

:< Haven't you got some work to do yet? " he shouted to the frightened 
duck. " You great lazy thing ! Here you are all day long, floating about 
doing nothing! You can leave Toytown on Saturday! Do you hear me? ' 
' Yes," said the duck unhappily. The policeman waded off, wishing 
that the rain would stop. But it didn't. It went on and on and on, and soon 
the duck pond was so big that the duck could take a really good swim. 
The whole field was under water, and all the hens fled to their house at the 
end of the meadow, whilst the pigs and goats stood huddled together near 
the farmhouse. 

" I suppose the doll is in bed," thought the duck. "Poor thing! She 
will be sad when she knows I must leave her. I will try and see her before 
I go on Saturday. Perhaps she will be up by then." 

Each day the duck looked out for the doll to come, but she didn't

appear. She was still in bed. The rain went on pouring down, and soon 
people began to say that there would be floods in Toytown. Such a thing 
had never happened before! 

The river overflowed and joined the pond on which the duck swam. 
Then what a great stretch of water there was for the duck to swim on! 
The water spread right up to the farmhouse, and the farmer's wife rushed 
upstairs in fright, for it poured in at her kitchen door! 

" We shall have to live in the bedrooms!" she cried. " Oh dear, oh 
dear! What a dreadful thing! All my kitchen chairs are floating about! ' 

The duck knew that it was Saturday, and he thought he would swim 
up to the farmhouse and look in at the bedroom windows until he found 
the room where his friend the doll lay. Then he would say good-bye. So 
up he swam. 

The floods were very bad now, and the water was right up to the bed- 
room windows! The duck swam round the farmhouse, peeping in at 
each window. 

Then he found the doll, sitting up in bed, looking very miserable and 

215 



RAIN IN TOYTOWN 

unhappy. The duck pecked on the glass with his beak, and the little doll 
jumped out of bed at once. 

" Oh, duck, I'm so glad you've come! " she said. " We are in a 
dreadful fix here. The farmer's wife hasn't any tea, or sugar, or bread, and 
we don't know how to get it, because of the floods. We can't go out, for 
the water is right over our heads ! Do you think you could float off to 
the butcher's and get some meat for us, and go to the grocer's and get 
some tea and sugar? ' 

" Of course! " said the duck in delight. " I'll do anything I can! 
You know that, doll! I'll go now! " 

So off he floated at top speed. He went into Toytown, which was 
also flooded, though not quite so badly as the houses just outside. He 
swam to the butcher's, grocer's, baker's and milkman, and asked them for 
meat, tea, sugar, bread and milk, and loaded everything on to his big 
broad back! Then back he swam very carefully. 

On the way he passed many other flooded houses. There were people 
at the windows, looking out very miserable. When they saw the duck 

going by with all the parcels on his 
back, they began to shout exci- 
tedly to one another. 

:< See! There's a duck with 
groceries ! Hi, duck ! Will you get 
some for me? Ho there, duck! 
When next you go to the butcher's 
kuy some chops for me! I say, 
duck, I'll give you sixpence if 
you'll go and fetch me some nice 
fresh fish from the fishmonger's." 
The duck listened to all the 
shouts and calls, and a marvellous 
idea came into his head ! He would 
do all the shopping for the people 
in the flooded houses ! What fun ! 
That would really be hard work, 
and he would be so pleased to do 
The water was right up to the windows. it ! He called out that he would

Back they floated to the houses and handed in the goods at the windows. 

soon be back, and then he floated at top speed to the farmhouse. He tapped 
on the window, and the doll opened it. She cried out in delight when she 
saw how well the duck had done the shopping. She lifted in the parcels, 
and as she took them the duck quacked out to her all the news. 

' The houses nearby are all flooded too," he said. ' * The people want 
me to go and do their shopping for them. If I go and do it, doll, I shall 
earn money, and then that policeman can't turn me out! ' 

" Oh, splendid! " cried the doll. " To-morrow I will come with you., 
My cold is nearly better. I will ask the people to give me written shopping 
lists, and then we will go together and buy everything." 

So the next day the doll sat on the duck's back, and he swam with her 
round to all the flooded houses. Everyone handed her a shopping list, and 
the duck and the doll hurried to the shops to get what was wanted. Then, 
when the duck's back was quite loaded, back they floated to the houses and 
handed in the goods at the windows. They were paid sixpence each time 
they went shopping, and soon the little bag that the doll kept the money in, 
jingled and clinked as she shopped. What a lot of money they were making ! 

217 



RAIN IN TOYTOWN 

" I shall be quite sorry when the rain stops," said the little doll. She 
had bought herself a mackintosh and sou'wester, and also a pair of Wel- 
lington boots. So she was quite all right. Everyone looked out for the 
little couple each morning now, and called to them from the top windows. 

One day, when the doll and duck were floating past the police station, 
on their way to the shops, a window was flung open, and the toy policeman 
called to them. 

" Hey! " he said. " Come here! " 

" Oh dear ! Do you suppose he wants to turn me out now? " said the 
poor duck, trembling so much that the doll was nearly shaken off his back. 
" I shan't go to him. I shall just pretend I don't see him." 

" Oh, we'd better go," said the doll. " It isn't good to be cowardly. 
Let's be brave and go." 

So they floated across to him. To their great surprise he beamed at 
them, and said: " Well, you certainly have made yourselves useful, you 
two ! Now look, here is my shopping list. Will you do my shopping for 
me too? I cannot get out of the police station." 

So they went to do the policeman's shopping as well, and weren't 
they pleased to put his sixpence into their bag! 

In three weeks' time the rain stopped and the floods began to go down. 
Little by little all the water drained away, and people were able to go in and 
out of the doors of their houses. The field round the farmhouse dried up 
and the little pond was itself again. The farmer came to the gate and 
called to the doll. 

" What about coming back to be my gardener again? " he shouted. 
" The duck can have the use of my pond, if he wishes ! ' 

" Oh dear! " groaned the duck. " What a dull life that will be, after 
this exciting three weeks! " 

" Don't worry, duck," said the doll, hugging him hard round the 
neck. " I've got such a lovely idea ! ' 

The duck was on the river, and the doll stepped off and ran to the 
farmer. " I'm sorry I can't come back," she said, " but I've bought a little 
house by the river, and I and the duck are going to live there, and do all the 
fetching and carrying for the folk who live on the riverside! ' 

The duck nearly fell over on the water when he heard this. Live with 
the doll in a little house and work for her ! Oh, could anything be better ! 

218 



RAIN IN TOYTOWN 

It was quite true. The doll had spent her sixpences well. She swam off 
with the duck, and took him to a tiny house on the riverside. It had 
curtains at the windows, and a tiny landing-stage. 

" There you are ! " she said. " That's our house! And all the folk who 
live nearby have promised that they will call you whenever they want to be 
taken from one side of the river to the other, duck and if they want any 
shopping done, we can go and get their shopping lists, and you can float 
with me down the river, till we come to the town. Then I shall jump off 
and do the shopping, and you can wait for me. I'll come back and put the 
parcels on your back, and off we'll go up the river once more. Isn't that 
lovely! " 

So that's what they do now. And in the evening, when the work is 
done, the doll carries the duck into her little house, and they sit on chairs 
opposite one another and drink hot cocoa together. 

Ah, they have a fine life together! But they did work hard for 
it, didn't they? 




Took him to a tiny house 
on the riverside.

THE BIT OF 
MAGIC PAPER 





ONCE upon a time a bit of paper blew into Gobby's garden. Gobby was 
a pixie, and he ran to pick up the paper, for he didn't like rubbish 
in his garden. 

But it wasn't rubbish. It was a page of notepaper, with writing 
on it. 

" Good gracious !" said Gobby. " It's Witch Heyho's writing ! I'll 
read it." 

Now Gobby should not have read it. He should have taken it 
straight back to Witch Heyho, who was writing busily in her garden a 
little way away. But Gobby was very curious to see what was written 
on the bit of paper, so he read it all. 

And he found it was a spell to make something grow. There should 
have been two pages to the spell, but Gobby thought the one page told 
him quite enough to use the magic. It was to make something black 
grow well. 

" Now let's see," thought Gobby, frowning till his eyes were almost 
shut. " Something black why, that must be black currants of course ! 
Witch Heyho has plenty of black-currant bushes in her garden, and she 
wants them to have lots of fruit this year. Aha ! This is part of the spell 
she has written here! What fun! Now I can make black currants grow 
too." 

He read the bit of paper again. " To make them grow big and black 
in crowds, get a pint of soot, a pint of moonlit dew, and stir up together 
with a peacock's feather," he read. " Add six petals of a wallflower, and 
the shine off a black stone. Say the four magic words, 'Quilla, coona, 
dalla, ho,' as quickly as you can, five times. Now choose the place where 
you want the magic to grow, and paint it carefully with the mixture." 

220 



THE BIT OF MAGIC PAPER 

Gobby rubbed his hands in excitement. Ah, he would make crowds 
of black currants grow he would have black-currant pie every day! 
How lovely! 

He wondered where to grow them. " I'd better not grow them in the 
garden," he thought. " If I do, Witch Heyho will see me. I'd better grow 
them indoors. I can easily pick some sprays of black-currant bush, and 
paint them with the magic indoors. Then the black currants will grow on 
the sprays, and I can pick them and make them into beautiful pies! ' 

Gobby thought he would tell his friend Peterkin about the spell he 
had found. Peterkin would help him to make the pastry for the pies. 

So he took the paper to Peterkin, and told him all about how he had 
found it flying into his garden. 

" But how do you know this spell will make black currants? " said 
Peterkin, in surprise. " It doesn't say so. It just says, * To make them 
grow big and black in crowds ' but it doesn't say what! ' 

" Ah, but I happen to know that Witch Heyho is very fond of black- 
currant pie," said Gobby impatiently. " And I'm sure she was writing 
out this spell to make the fruit grow well on her bushes. Will you come 
along and help me to make the pastry for our pies now? Then we'll grow 
the black currants, and use them whilst they are nice and fresh and juicy. 
A good black-currant tart is a perfectly delicious meal to have." 

Peterkin put on his hat and went back with Gobby to his house. 
Gobby picked twenty sprays of black-currant bush from his garden. He 
set them in twenty little jars of water in the kitchen. Then he began to 
make the spell. 

* There's some soot we can have out of the kitchen chimney," he 
said, " and I've plenty of moonlit dew. Now for the six wallflower petals. 
Go and see if you can find some on that late wallflower at the bottom of 
the garden, Peterkin. And you might bring in a nice shiny black stone 
with you too." 

Peterkin went out and soon came back with some velvety wallflower 
petals and a large black stone. Very solemnly and carefully the two made 
the magic mixture, and stirred it with the peacock's feather that Gobby 
always kept handy for the making of spells. He scraped the shine off the 
black stone and it fell into the black mixture and made it fizz like sherbert. 
It was very queer. 

221 



THE BIT OF MAGIC PAPER 




Very solemnly and carefully the two made the magic mixture. 



" Quilla, coona, dalla, ho ! " chanted Gobby, as he stirred and stirred. 
" QuiUa, coona, dalla, ho! " 

When the spell was finished, Gobby and Peterkin painted the black- 
currant sprays with it in great glee. " The currants will take a little time to 
grow," said Gobby. " We will make the pastry for the pies whilst we are 
waiting." 

But, you know, that spell wasn't meant to make black currants, but 
black beetles ! Fancy that ! So it wasn't long before nice large shiny black 
beetles began to grow on the black-currant sprays. They didn't stay there 
very long though they ran down the stalks and harried about the kitchen 
floor, looking for something to eat. 

Suddenly Gobby saw them. Now Gobby, like a great many people, 
was afraid of black beetles, though they could do him no harm. So he gave 
a loud yell, and almost scared Peterkin out of his skin. 

" Ooooh! Ow! Look! What are all these beetles in here for? ' 

Peterkin wasn't afraid of beetles, and he looked at them in astonish- 
ment. " How queer! " he said. " I didn't know you had beetles in your 
kitchen, Gobby." 

222 



THE BIT OF MAGIC PAPER 

" I haven't! " squealed Gobby. " Where are they coming from oh, 
where are they coming from? * 

Peterkin looked and saw that they were streaming down the stalks of 
the black-currant sprays in dozens. He began to look- scared. 

" Gobby! Look! They are growing on those sprays! I don't believe 
that was a spell for black currants after all I believe it was for black 
beetles. Oh, goodness, whatever shall we do? ' 

Gobby stared in horror, and saw that what Peterkin had said was 
right. He had grown black beetles instead of black currants! How 
dreadful! 

" Oh, take those sprays into the garden, quick, and burn them!" 
he begged Peterkin. But Peterkin wouldn't touch them. He suddenly 
opened the door and ran home. He didn't like being mixed up with 
strange spells that went wrong. You never knew what might happen 
next. 

Gobby began to cry. He rushed out and went to Witch Heyho's. 
He told her what had happened, and begged her to make a spell to 
get rid of all the black beetles. 

At first Witch Heyho looked stern when she heard how Gobby had 
picked up her bit of magic paper and had read it and used it but then, as 
she caught sight of the black beetles wandering out of Gobby's kitchen 
door into the garden, she began to laugh. 

" Oh dear, dear me! " she laughed; " what a shock for you to get 
black beetles instead of black currants! Never mind, Gobby, I won't 
punish you but I really don't in the least know how to stop the spell. 
You'll just have to put up with the beetles." 

And that was all the comfort poor Gobby got from the witch. But she 
told him that hedgehogs love a good meal of beetles, so he is going to buy 
one from the pet-shop, and keep him in the kitchen. Then perhaps he 
won't have them eating the food out of the larder, and sleeping in his bed, 
and crawling into his shoes. Poor Gobby! 

It's always best to make sure of a spell before you use it so do be 
careful of magic, won't you, just in case you make a mistake like Gobby!

A Frieze of Christinas Trees 

IN the Christmas holidays we'll do all kinds of things. Shall we make a 
frieze of pine trees to go round our walls? It's so easy. 

Get a long strip of paper, green if possible. If you can't get green, 
colour a strip of white paper with green paint or chalks. 

Now fold your strip of paper over and over and over. Now look at 
Picture I. That shows the paper folded over, with the outline of half a 
pine-tree drawn on the top fold. You can draw that easily. Do it exactly 
as it is done in the picture. 

Now take your scissors and cut round the outline of the pine-tree, 
through all the folds of paper, but be very careful not to cut where I 
have marked the drawing with little stars. If you cut it there, you will 
spoil everything. 

Now have you cut out the half pine-tree? Good! Unfold your 
paper and see what you have a lovely frieze of pine-trees (Picture 2). 
If you paste them on to a strip of black or brown paper, they will make a 
beautiful Christmassy frieze.

Pinkity's Party Frock 

PINKTTY was a pixie who loved to go to parties. She went to the rab- 
bits' parties, and to the mouse picnics. She loved going to the 
fairies' parties, and dear me, what a treat it was to go to a party at the 
palace. 

Pinkity lived in Jenny's garden but Jenny didn't know! Pinkity had 
a tiny house under the old lilac bush. All the mice knew it well and so did 
the two rabbits who lived at the end of the garden. One of the hens knew it 
too, for she had gone under the bush to lay an egg. But Jenny didn't know, 
though she had played round the bush a dozen times a day! 

Jenny played with her doll Rosebud. She loved her very much, for 
Rosebud was a pretty, cuddlesome doll, whose eyes shut to go to sleep, and 
who could say " Ma-ma " in a very baby-like voice. Rosebud had two lots 
of dresses a pink silk one with a white sash, and a blue cotton one for 
mornings. 

Pinkity often used to watch Jenny playing with Rosebud. One day, as 
Pinkity was peeping through the leaves at Jenny, the postman came with 
a letter for the pixie. The postman was a little mouse. Pinkity took the 
letter in excitement. 

" I hope it's a party invitation! " she cried. And it was! It was from 
the Fairy Goldywings, and the party was to be the next day, Monday, a 
picnic party on Breezy Hill. 

" Oh, what fun! " cried Pinkity. " I shall make myself a dress and hat 
of pink rose-petals. I shall look fine! ' 

That night she went to collect the pink rose-petals from Jenny's 

H 225 



PINKITY'S PARTY FROCK 

garden. She came across old Shellyback, Jenny's tortoise, lying asleep in 
the grass. Pinkity laughed. 

" I shall use you for a stool to sit on ! " she said. So she sat down on 
the tortoise's back, and began to make her pink frock and hat. First she 
made the hat and fitted it on her head. Really, it looked very pretty, all 
made of silky petals. Then she began to make the frock. 

She worked till dawn, and then she had to go and fetch some more 
pink thread from her little house. So she dropped the little frock lightly 
on to the ground by the tortoise and ran ofl. 

When she came back, whatever do you think had happened? Why, 
the old tortoise had awakened, and put his head out of his shell. He had 
seen the rose-petal frock and had begun to eat it up! 

You see, rose-petals were a great treat to him. He loved a feast of 
them and didn't often get them. So when he saw the rose-petal frock, he 
began to gobble it up in delight! 

Well, poor Pinkity sat down and cried and cried when she saw what 
was happening ! " You horrid unkind thing ! " she sobbed. " Here I've 
spent all night long making my new frock and you eat it in about two 
minutes! ' 

" Sorry! " said Shellyback. " I didn't know it was a frock. I thought 
it was just rose-petals and I'm very fond of them." 

" It's Monday morning now and there won't be time to make myself 
a frock again," sobbed Pinkity. " I shan't be able to go to the picnic this 
afternoon! " 

" I'm very sorry," said Shellyback again. He did wish he could do 
something! 

Pinkity slipped back to her house under the bush, still crying. Shelly- 
back pulled at the grass and waited for Jenny to come out to play. 

When she came out she looked very important. It was Monday and 
she was going to have a washing-day just like Mother! She had washed 
Rosebud's pink silk frock, and her white petticoat and vest, and had 
washed her pram-cover and pillow-case too. Now Mother had put her up a 
little clothes line in the garden to hang the things on to dry! 

The tortoise watched Jenny pegging up all the clothes. He wished he 
could tell her about Pinkity, but he had only a hiss for a voice and Jenny 
wouldn't understand. 

226 



PINKITY'S PARTY FROCK 




The tortoise watched Jenny pegging up all the clothes. 

Jenny went indoors then to get her hat and coat for a walk. Shelly- 
back watched the clothes flying on the line and went on eating. 

The wind blew hard. It blew the little clothes on the little line and it 
blew Mother's big clothes on the big line. It blew so hard that it blew the 
pink silk frock off the line altogether, and it flew off and wrapped itself 
round the tortoise's head! 

He was surprised! He put his head into his shell at once. Then he 
poked it out again to see what it was that had dropped on him. 

It was Rosebud's best pink silk frock and the tortoise stared at it in 
excitement. Just the thing for Pinkity to wear at the picnic! If only it 
would fit her! 

Shellyback picked the frock up in his mouth and crawled under the 
lilac bush with it. Pinkity was there, still crying. How she stared when she 
saw the tortoise bringing the pink silk frock! 

"Oh! Oh! Where did you get it from? " she cried. "What a 
beautiful dress and I believe it will just fit me and will match my new 
rose-petal bonnet beautifully." She slipped the frock over her head and 

227 




PINKITY'S PARTY FROCK 

tied the white sash round. How 
sweet she looked! 

" Oh, thank you! " she said to 
Shellyback, kissing his little blunt 
nose. " I'll wear it to the picnic! " 

She ironed it out, and then 
put it on for the picnic with her 
pretty pink bonnet. Off she went, 
as happy as could be and how 
every one admired her in her pretty 
silk frock! 

Poor Jenny was upset when 
she came in from her walk and 
found the pink silk frock had been 
blown off the line. She hunted and 
hunted for it but, of course, she 
couldn't find it! Then it was her 
turn to weep ! 

The tortoise heard her crying 
and soon knew why. How un- 
comfortable he felt ! First he had eaten Pinkity's rose-petal frock and made 
her cry and now he had taken away Jenny's doll's frock and made her cry. 
He went to the lilac bush and waited for Pinkity to come home. 

When she came he told her how upset Jenny was. " Oh dear! " said 
Pinkity, " what a shame ! Well, I'll soon wash and iron this frock, Shelly- 
back, and then I'll give it back to Jenny for Rosebud. And I'll give her 
my rose-petal bonnet too. It should fit the doll nicely." 

So that evening Pinkity washed and ironed the pink frock, and then 
packed it up in a little box, with the pink bonnet too. She flew up to the 
nursery window, slipped in at the top, and left the box on the table. 

When Jenny found it and opened it the next morning, she could 
hardly believe her eyes ! " Oh, look ! " she said, " here's my doll's frock 
back and a lovely rose-petal bonnet too! It will just fit Rosebud." 

So it did, and she wears it every time she goes out. Jenny would so 
love to know who made it. Shellyback has told her heaps of times, but she 
doesn't understand his hisses. I wish I could tell her, don't you? 

228 



" Oh, thank you," she said to 
Shellyback. 



Shadows on the Wall 

WHEN people make shadows of ducks 
or rabbits or faces on the wall, we 
all think they are very clever indeed. 

Well, let's make some ourselves! All 
you want is a wall for the shadows, a 
bright light behind your hands and your 
hands themselves. Now, are we ready? 
Then let's make a duck with just one 
hand. 

Isn't it easy? Just touch your thumb 
with the tip of your bent first finger, bend 
down the middle finger out of the way, and 
let the other two fingers stand up, as in the 
picture. Hey presto, there's a duck! Its 
beak is open, it is quacking. (But it is 
really you who are quacking.) 

Now a rabbit. Two hands for this, 
please, and put them exactly as I have 
drawn for you in the picture. That's right 
and here's the shadow rabbit, ears and all. Good, isn't he? 

Now we'll have a butterfly with fluttering wings. Can you make it? 
Of course you can! 

And now a funny face, with a pointed nose! Do you see how to put 
your hands? You do and there's the shadow-face on the wall, nose and 
all! 

You'll have to practise a bit before you can do the shadows really 
well. It's fun, isn't it?

BILLY! 
LITTLE BOAT) 



ONCE upon a time, not so very long ago, a crowd of little brownies 
had to leave their home hurriedly. 

They lived in Bluebell Wood, and one day it was sold to a builder. 
Alas for the brownies and the rabbits, the birds and the little mice they 
all had to leave when the trees were chopped down, and the wood made 
ready for houses to be built all over it! 

The birds flew to another wood. The rabbits fled to the hillside a 
mile away. The little mice held a meeting, and decided to hide somewhere 
till the houses were built, and then become house-mice and live on food in 
the larders of the houses. 

The brownies, too, held a meeting. They were very tiny folk, these 
brownies, so small that you could easily hold six in your hand together. 
They were small enough to use a violet leaf for an umbrella, so you can 
guess how tiny they were. 

" We will go to our cousins, who live in the Wishing Wood," said 
the chief brownie, Chippy. " I know the way quite well. You go through 
the wood down the lane across the river and up the hill. On the 
other side is the Wishing Wood. It is a big place and there will be plenty 
of room for us to live there with our cousins." 

So one night they set off. They ran through their own spoilt wood. 
They went down the lane, which seemed simply enormous to them. 
Then they came to the river. 

230 



BILLY'S LITTLE BOATS 

But here they had to stop in dismay. They hadn't thought at all how 
they were to cross it! Now what were they to do? 

" We haven't wings, so we can't fly," said Chippy. 

" And there are no boats about," said Tiggy. 

" Not even a leaf or two we could use as a raft," said Snippy. 

" What shall we do? " said every one together. " We must get across 
to-night! " 

A rabbit popped his head out of a nearby hole. " What's the matter? " 
he said. 

" Oh, can you help us? " asked the brownies, and they told the 
rabbit their trouble. 

" No, I can't help you," said the rabbit, shaking his whiskery head. 
" But I know a very, very kind little boy called Billy, who lives in that 
house over there. He is very clever and be might help you. He once got 
me out of a trap. Go and knock at his window. He'll wake and do his 
best for you." 

It was moonlight and the brownies could see the window that the 
rabbit pointed to. It had bars across, for it was a nursery window. They 
thanked the rabbit and ran to the garden hedge, crept through it and ran 
to the house. They climbed up the thick ivy, and stood on Billy's window- 
sill. By the moonlight that shone into the room they could quite well 
see Billy, fast asleep in his small bed. 

Chippy tapped at the window. Billy stirred. Chippy tapped again. 
Billy sat up, wide awake. When he saw the brownies at the window he 
was too astonished to speak. Then he jumped out of bed and ran to let 
them in. 

" Oh! " he said, " you dear little tiny creatures! I've always longed 
to see the little folk and now I really have. I do hope I'm awake and 
not dreaming! ' 

" Oh, you're awake all right," said Chippy. " Listen, Billy! A rabbit 
told us you were clever and kind. Do you think you could help us? ' 

" I can try," said Billy, at once. " What do you want me to do? ' : 
* Well," said Chippy, " we have to leave our home and we want to 
get to Wishing Wood, which is across the river and over the hill. We 
haven't wings to fly over the river, and we haven't boats. Could you tell 
us how to get across, please, Billy? ' : 

231 



BILLY'S LITTLE BOATS 

Billy thought hard for a moment. " Let me see," he said. " It's no 
use lending you my ship it's far too big. And I've lost the oars of my 
little boat. And paper boats would soak with water and sink half-way 
across. Oh! I know! I know! I've thought of just the right thing for 
you! " 

" What? What? " cried the brownies excitedly. 

" I'll make you walnut-shell boats! " said Billy. " They'll be just the 
right size for you. One of you will go nicely into each. They float beauti- 
fully and I can make you tiny sails so that the wind will blow you 
across! ' 

Billy ran downstairs. He had counted the brownies and there were 




As soon as the brownies saw how the boats were made, they began to help. 

232 



BILLY'S LITTLE BOATS 

eleven of them. He took six walnuts from the dish of nuts on the dining- 
room sideboard. 

He ran upstairs again. He carefully slit each walnut into its two half- 
shells and took out the nut. He and the brownies chewed the nuts between 
them as Billy worked. 

" Now, there you are! " said Billy, when he had the six shells empty, 
standing neatly in their halves. " Twelve little boats ! Good ! Now I'll 
make the masts and the sails." 

He got out a box in which he kept all sorts of odds and ends. In it 
were a lot of dead matches. Billy was not allowed to touch proper 
matches, only ones that had already been struck, but he had quite a lot 
of these. 

He took a dead match and made holes in a small piece of white paper 
so that he could slip the bit of paper on the match for a sail ! The march 
was the mast, you see. When he had got the sail nicely fixed, he looked 
for his tube of seccotine. 

" What's that? " asked the brownies in surprise, as they saw Billy 
squee2ing a tiny, sticky sort of worm out of the tube on to the end of the 
match. 

" It's seccotine sticky stuff that sticks things together," said Billy. 
" This drop of seccotine will stick the end of the match to the bottom 
of the walnut shell, you see, brownies and then you will have a nice 
straight mast, with a dear little sail to catch the wind! ' 

The brownies were simply amazed to see Billy making them the dear 
little walnut-shell boats. Billy was so quick and so clever! 

He stuck the match into the bottom of a shell. He arranged the bit 
of paper for a sail. The boat was ready ! 

" One boat done," he said. " Now for the next! " 

As soon as the brownies saw how the boats were made, they began 
to help. Tiggy got in a bit of a mess with the seccotine, which stuck to 
his hands, and then everything seemed to stick to him\ Poor Tiggy! 

It was not long before there were twelve boats finished. " You only 
need eleven," said Billy, " but it would be quite a good idea to let the 
twelfth boat carry your bits of luggage. I can tie it on to one of the other 
boats." 

Soon Billy and the brownies were creeping quietly down the garden 

233 



BILLY'S LITTLE BOATS 

to the river. Billy carried all the boats on a tiny tray, for fear of spoiling 
them. When he came to the river, he set the tray down on the ground. 

He launched one tiny boat, and it bobbed up and down beautifully on 
the ripples. The wind pulled at the tiny sail. Billy carefully put a brownie 
in the boat, and away it went, bobbing merrily over the river. Then 
another boat followed it and another and another till the whole fleet 
was sailing away, looking perfectly lovely on the moonlit water. 

The last but one had the twelfth luggage boat tied to the back of it. 
The two little boats bobbed safely away, the brownie in the first one 
waving good-bye. Billy stood and watched his fleet of walnut-shell boats 
sailing across to the other side, the wind blowing hard on the little paper 
sails. Not one boat sank. 

" I do feel proud and pleased," said Billy to himself. " I've really 
done something to-night. I'll go to Wishing Wood some day and see 
if I can find those brownies again! ' 

He hasn't been yet, but I expect he will go soon. Would you like 
to make a fleet of walnut-shell boats like Billy? You can, easily. Sail 
them in the bath and they will look fine! 




The whole fleet was sailing away. 



. 2 34 




ONCE upon a time there were nine little elves who lived in a small 
mushroom house on the edge of Cuckoo Wood. It was a fine house, 
and suited the elves well. 

But one day a most annoying thing happened a farmer came that 
way, saw the large mushroom, and picked it! He put it into his coat- 
pocket, with fairies and all in it though he didn't know they were there, 
of course. 

The elves had a terrible shock. They squeezed out of the door of the 
mushroom house, and found themselves in the dark pocket. They found 
their way to the opening of the pocket and peeped out. In a trice they had 
spread their cobwebby wings and had flown to the ground. 

" My goodness ! " said Goldie- wings, " that was a narrow escape ! ' 

"We've lost our lovely house!' said Gossamer, beginning to 
cry. 

" It will be cooked," said Tippytoe. 

" Never mind," said Twinkles. " We'll find another." 

" But we haven't any furniture now," said Tiptap. 

They flew over the fields till they came to where a family of rabbits 
was nibbling the grass. 

" Good morning ! " said Goldie- wings. " I suppose you couldn't tell 
us of any good house to be sold? Ours has just been picked by a farmer, 
and will be cooked. So we want another." 

" No," said the father-rabbit, thinking so hard that his ears went 
crooked. " No I don't know of any." 

2 35 



THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN FAIRIES 

" I do, though! " said one of the little rabbits. " You know our 
cousin, who lives in the hutch in the garden over there, don't you? Well, 
he told me about a beautiful little house, with windows and doors and 
furniture and everything, in the children's nursery there. Why don't the 
fairies see if that is for sale? ' 

" That's a good idea," said Gossamer. " But wait a minute! It would 
never do for the children or any one to see us. Why, we might be caught 
and put in a cage or something! ' 

" Oh, you needn't be afraid of that," said the father-rabbit at once. 
" The nursery belongs to Jonathan and Lucy, two children who don't 
believe in fairies. So you'll be quite safe, because, as you know perfectly 
well, people who don't believe in fairies can't see them even if they are 
under their noses." 

" Oh, that's good," said Tiptap. " Come along you others we'll go 
and find this lovely house." 

The nine elves all trooped off, and soon came to the house. They 
knew which was the nursery window because it had bars across. Up they 

flew, and stood on the window-sill 
to peep in. Nobody was in the 
nursery at all. 

The window was open at the 
bottom. The elves slipped in and 
flew down to the nursery floor. 
They looked round. Where was 
this wonderful house that the 
rabbits had told them about? 

" There it is ! Over there in 
the corner!" squealed Goldie- 
wings in delight. So it was a 
beautiful dolls' house with a blue 
front door, a tiny brass knocker, a 
letter-box, nice casement windows, 
and blue curtains! Marvellous! 

The nine elves ran up to it, 
squeaking with joy. 

" I wonder if any one lives 




Oh, we thought the house was empty." 



236 



THEY DONT BELIEVE IN FAIRIES 

here," said Twinkles, and she knocked at the door. The elves heard foot- 
steps coming and the door opened. A little doll, not much bigger than 
themselves, looked at them in astonishment. 

" Oh," said Tiptap, " we thought perhaps this house was empty." 

" No, I live here," said the small doll, who was dressed like a little 
girl. " But it's terribly lonely living here all by myself. I was surprised to 
hear some one knocking at my door." 

" We really came to see if the house was for sale," said Goldie- wings. 
" Our house was picked to-day it was a large mushroom, you see so 
we are looking for another." 

" This house isn't for sale," said the tiny doll. " It belongs to Jona- 
than and Lucy, two children. But do come in. I'd love you to live with 
me, if only you think there is enough room." 

All the elves went in at the little door. They shouted with joy to see 
the beautiful rooms and dainty furniture everywhere. There were three 
bedrooms, a drawing-room with a piano, a dining-room, and a fine kitchen 
with a little stove. 

" It's perfect it's perfect! " cried the elves. " There are quite enough 
beds for us, for there are two beds in each room that's six. We can get 
two in a bed easily, so there are more than enough beds, counting one for 
you too, little doll." 

" My name is Belinda," said the doll. " Do come and live here. 
Think of the fun we can have together the cookings on the stove the 
games of snap and snakes and ladders in the evening when the children 
are in bed the fun we'll have cleaning the house together the parties 
we'll give to all the toys! ' 

" We'll come! " said the elves, and they solemnly shook hands with 
Belinda, whose eyes were shining with joy. 

" You needn't be afraid of being seen," said Belinda, " because, 
although there are two children here, they don't believe in fairies. Isn't 
that lucky! They can't see you if they don't believe in you, as you know." 

Well, it didn't take long for the nine elves to settle down in the dolls' 
house with Belinda. The fun they had choosing and making their little 
beds ! They opened every drawer in the chests and chose which one each 
of them would have. They tried cooking toffee on the tiny kitchen stove, 
and it smelt so good that the golliwog, the teddy-bear, and the clockwork 

237 



THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN FAIRIES 




They slipped out of the back door and popped into the bookcase. 

mouse all came knocking at the front door to see if they might have a taste. 

Belinda was very happy. She had been so lonely before, but now she 
had company all day and all night. The elves were always about, going in 
and out, knocking at the front door, cooking, making beds, cleaning, 
having a party, or playing tricks on one another. 

At first Belinda had been half afraid the two children would see the 
elves, when they had come into the nursery to play. Belinda had sat down 
stiffly in her chair as soon as Jonathan had come in, and when Lucy 
opened the door of the dolls' house and looked in, she had seen Belinda 
sitting still just as usual. 

But she didn't see the nine elves busy about the house. She didn't 

238 



THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN FAIRIES 

see Goldie-wings scrubbing the kitchen floor. She didn't see Gossamer 
playing the piano in the little drawing-room. She didn't see Twinkles and 
Tiptap having a game of hide-and-seek in the bedrooms. 

Ah, but Lucy was astonished at some things she saw! She couldn't 
think who had been polishing the stove till it shone. She couldn't think 
who had washed the curtains at the windows. She couldn't think who had 
set the little clock going on the wall. It was all most mysterious. 

And then one day some one came to tea. It was a friend of Lucy's, 
called Mirabel. She believed in fairies and as soon as Lucy opened the 
front of the dolls' house, Mirabel saw the elves ! 

" Oh! " she cried, " fairies! You've got fairies living in your dolls' 
house with Belinda! Look! ' 

But even as Lucy tried to see them, they hid themselves away, and 
soon not even Mirabel could see them either. They had slipped out of the 
back door and had popped into the bookshelf behind, hiding themselves 
among the books. 

" You are a story-teller, Mirabel ! " said Lucy. " I'll believe there 
are fairies there if you catch one for me and show me one. I don't believe 
in fairies at all." 

" Well, it's no good my catching you one then, for you wouldn't 
see it if I did," said Mirabel, and she didn't say a single word more, 
though she couldn't help wondering where the nine little elves had 
gone. 

They are all living in the dolls' house still, and Belinda doesn't 
know what she would do without them now. As for Jonathan and 
Lucy, they haven't seen one of them and they never will; but if you 
happen to go and play with Lucy, open her dolls' house and peep inside. 
You will be surprised to see those tiny, bright-eyed elves! 



239 






SUMMER holidays at last! 
Now's the time for fun, 
Happy days are slipping past 
In the wind and sun. 
Splashing in the curling waves, 
Racing on the sand, 
Playing smugglers in the caves, 
Holidays are grand! 
Building castles, digging moats, 
Prawning in the pool, 
Sailing little ships and boats, 
No such thing as school! 
Shouting, laughing, here we go, 
Splashing gaily past, 
It's summer holidays you know, 
Yes, they've come at last!

THE TALE 

OF CHUCKLE 

AND PIP 




CHUCKLE and Pip were two small pixies with pointed ears, twinkling 
eyes, and merry voices. They made sunshades, umbrellas, and para- 
chutes, and were really very clever. 

They had a shop just outside the King's palace walls, and they made 
the prettiest frilly sunshades, the gayest umbrellas, and the strongest para- 
chutes that ever were seen. The tiny money-spiders bought the parachutes 
and used them when they wanted to leave their homes and go somewhere 
else. They swung the parachute into the air, 
caught hold of it, and away they floated on 
the wind. 

The fairies bought the sunshades and the 
umbrellas but trade was very bad at the 
moment. The sun had not really been strong 
enough for sunshades, the spiders were quite 
content to stay at home, and there had been no 
rain for weeks. 

" We haven't sold a single umbrella, sun- 
shade or parachute for ages," said Chuckle 
gloomily. 

"I know! " said Pip. "I really don't 
know what we are going to do about it. If 
only the sun would shine all day long we could 
sell our stock of sunshades or if only it would 
rain we could sell our umbrellas! ' 

" There's a party at the palace to-morrow," 
said Chuckle. " That means that every one 
will pass our shop. Just suppose it poured 




We haven't sold an umbrella 
for ages. 



241 



THE TALE OF CHUCKLE AND PIP 

with rain; Pip, when every one was going by in their best! What a lot of 
umbrellas we should sell! ' 

Pip sat and thought. Yes if only it would rain! If only they could 
make it rain ! An idea came into his head a very naughty one. He laughed. 

" Chuckle, I've got a plan! " he said. " What about me climbing that 
big tree by the palace gate with two or three watering-cans full of 
water! " 

" Are you mad, Pip? " asked Chuckle, puzzled. 

" No," said Pip. " Don't you see the idea, Chuckle? As people go by 
in their best party-frocks I'll water them with my watering-can and 
they'll think it's raining and go off in a great hurry to buy an umbrella 
from you! ' 

" Oooooh! That is a fine idea ! " said naughty Chuckle, and he laughed 
till he cried. " Can't I be the one to sit in the tree and water people, Pip? " 

" No," said Pip firmly. " It's my idea and I shall do the watering. 
We'll put the cans of water up the tree to-night when no one is looking." 

" But how can we climb a tree with a can of water in our hand? " 
said Chuckle. 

" We shan't," said Pip. " I shall climb up the tree, and let down a 
rope. You will tie the watering-can carefully to the rope and I will haul 
it up and put it safely on that big broad branch on the west side of the tree." 

" You are clever at ideas, Pip," said Chuckle. " I'm longing for 
to-night! " 

Well, that night the two naughty pixies carried out their plan. Pip 
climbed the tree and let down the rope. Chuckle tied a full watering-can 
on to it. Pip hauled it up and hid it safely. Then he let down the rope 
again. He hauled up two big watering-cans, one small one, and three hot- 
water cans as well, which he said he could use to fill the watering-cans 
with when they were empty. Naughty Pip! 

They went to bed. The next day was cloudy with no sun. But the 
clouds were too high for rain. Pip chuckled when he thought of how he 
was going to make rainy weather for all the palace guests that afternoon! 

Chuckle put out all his prettiest umbrellas. Pip climbed the tree at 
three o'clock and waited patiently for the first person to come along. 

It was Dame Thump, in her very best blue silk dress with the red bows. 
Just as she walked beneath the tree Pip tipped up one of his watering-cans. 

242 



THE TALE OF CHUCKLE AND PIP 

" Pitter-patter, pitter-patter ! ' The water splashed down on Dame 
Thump. What a state she was in! 

" Oh, my best frock ! Oh, will it be spoilt before I get to the palace ! 
Now who would have thought it would rain like this ! If only I had an 
umbrella ! " she said. Then she remembered that Chuckle's shop was just 
nearby, and she hurried to buy a blue umbrella to match her frock. 
Chuckle was delighted. 

Pip laughed so much that he nearly fell out of the tree. He just 
managed to save himself in time to give Dame Thump a gentle splashing 
as she passed by with her new um- 
brella held over her head. 

Then came Mr. and Mrs. 
Spink with all their four children. 
They were very smart indeed. Mr. 
Spink had on a yellow silk suit 
with hat arid feather to match. 
Mrs. Spink had on a frock as bright 
as the sun. All the children were 
dressed alike in red frocks and 
tunics. 

Pip grinned. He tipped up his 
watering-can. First he watered Mr. 
Spink and his yellow hat. Then he 
watered Mrs. Spink and her glitter- 
ing frock. Then he watered all the 
little Spinks, who cried out in 
dismay. 

" Mother! Father! It's rain- The water s P lashed on Dame Thump. 
ing on our new dresses! Didn't you bring an umbrella? ' : 

" No," said Mr. Spink, looking up at the sky. " Dear, dear! Well, I 
think it's stopping now. Let's stand under this tree, dears, and we shall 
keep dry." But it was no place to stand if they wanted to keep dry! Pip 
nearly burst himself with trying not to laugh, and he at once emptied a 
whole canful over the Spink family! 

" Oh, the rain is simply pouring down! " said poor Mrs. Spink. 
" It's even soaking through the tree. Look ! There is an umbrella shop, 

243 




THE TALE OF CHUCKLE AND PIP 




He tipped up his watering-can. First he watered Mr. Spink and his yellow hat. 

Mr. Spink. We must certainly buy umbrellas, or we shall be soaked 
through before we arrive, and we don't want the dear King to think we 
are a family of drowned rats! ' 

They hurried to Chuckle's shop. They bought one big umbrella to 
share between Mr. and Mrs. Spink, and four tiny umbrellas, one for each 
child. Then they set off happily to the palace, holding them over their heads. 

Pip laughed loudly, and Chuckle poked his head out of the shop-door 
and laughed too. Then he caught sight of two or three more people 
coming along. " Sh! " he said. " Here are Fairy Trip, Pixie Tiptoe, 
and Brownie Longbeard." 

Well, as soon as they passed under Pip's tree, Trip, Tiptoe, and 
Longbeard got a good watering. How disgusted they were! 

:< Raining ! " said Longbeard, shaking the drops out of his beautiful 
silvery beard. " What bad luck! " 

" And I left my umbrella at home ! " said Fairy Trip. 

244 



THE TALE OF CHUCKLE AND PIP 

" I shall be soaked! " said Tiptoe, who had on a very thin dress of 
spider's thread. 

" What shall we do? " said Longbeard. Pip helped them to think by 
watering them again. They caught sight of Chuckle's shop. " Look! He 
sells umbrellas ! " they cried. " Let's get some ! We'll be all right then! " 

Off they went and bought three expensive umbrellas. Then they set 
off to the palace once more, rather puzzled because the rain seemed to 
have completely stopped! 

Pip was having a glorious time. He could hardly sit still in his hiding- 
place, he was so excited. To think that his idea was acting so well! 

Other guests came along and Pip watered them all. As every one was 
in best clothes they all rushed to get umbrellas. Soon Chuckle hadn't a 
single umbrella left and he began to sell his sunshades as umbrellas. He 
was doing very well indeed though his customers were rather puzzled 
by his giggles! But as his name was Chuckle, they thought he couldn't 
help giggling a bit. 

Now when every one arrived at the palace, complete with umbrellas, 
complaining of the rain, the King was most astonished. 

" Raining! " he said. " Impossible! " 

" Not at all impossible, Your Majesty! " said Longbeard. " Look at 
my beard. It's soaked! ' 

" But I made a special bit of magic to-day to keep the rain off," said 
the King. " It can't possibly rain to-day." 




As every one was in his best clothes they all rushed to get umbrellas. 

245 



THE TALE OF CHUCKLE AND PIP 

" Well, Your Majesty, it did" said Fairy Trip. " Just as we came 
to the gate it poured down! ' 

" Yes by that big tree," said Mr. Spink. " We had to go and buy 
umbrellas." 

" It was raining as we passed under that tree too," said some one else. 

" And it started just as I got there too," said Dame Thump. " But 
it didn't seem to be raining anywhere else." 

The King looked more and more surprised. " Well," he said, " this 
is astonishing. First of all, I say that it could not rain to-day, because I 
made a spell against rain. And then you say that it only rained under that 




"Not at all impossible, Your Majesty," said Longbeard. 

246 



THE TALE OF CHUCKLE AND PIP 

tree when, as every one knows, it rains all around if it rains at all, not just 
in one small place! This is puzzling! I must inquire into it! ' 

The King sent the Lord High Chamberlain down to see into the 
matter. The Chamberlain, who was a very rich and grand man, most 
beautifully dressed in cloth of gold, stepped down the palace drive to the 
gate. Then he walked haughtily to the big tree that stood by the gate. 

Pip was still there. He saw the Lord High Chamberlain and grinned. 
My goodness, if only he could make him buy an umbrella or a sunshade 
he would buy the finest one in the whole shop! 

He tipped up a watering-can pitter-patter, down went the water! 
The Chamberlain was most astonished and annoyed. Could it be raining 
after all? He looked up at the tree. 

And he saw Pip's naughty, cheeky face 
peeping there! He knew at once what had 
been happening. He commanded the frigh- 
tened pixie to come down and he fetched 
Chuckle too. Holding them by their big 
pointed ears he took them back to the palace 
with him. 

" These pixies watered every one who 
passed by, so that they would go and buy um- 
brellas," said the Lord High Chamberlain in 
an awful voice. 

" Is that so? " said the King, also in a very 




stern voice. " Then I make a law in future 



The Chamberlain was a very 
rich and grand man. 



that nobody in the whole of Fairyland shall 

buy anything from these two bad pixies. You may go, pixies." 

They went, crying bitterly. They knew that they would have hard 
work to make a living now, for nobody would buy from them. Poor Pip 
and Chuckle! 

But they soon found a job with the dandelions, who were very good 
to them. Do you know what they do? Guess! Yes they make those 
beautiful little parachutes that are fitted to every dandelion-seed ! Find a 
dandelion-clock and take the seeds into your hand. You will see that 
you have dozens of little parachutes there, made of the finest hair. Blow 
them into the air and see how well they fly!

Big-Hands and Nobbly 

ONCE upon a time Nobbly the Goblin quarrelled with Big-Hands the 
Gnome. They lived next door to one another and had always been 
good friends till this quarrel. 

It was a very silly quarrel, really. It happened that Tip-tap the butcher 
had called at Nobbly's with his meat, and Nobbly was out. So the butcher 
had left it on the window-sill and when Nobbly came home he saw 
Big-Hands' cat licking the meat! 

He rushed in to Big-Hands' Cottage in a furious rage. 

" That cat of yours has licked my meat ! " he cried. " Smack it, Big- 
Hands, smack it! ' 

" Certainly not," said Big-Hands, who was very fond of his cat. " How 
can you expect a cat not to lick meat if it is left on a window-sill. You 
should go and scold the butcher for doing such a foolish thing. Why, any 
other cat but mine would have stolen the meat and taken it away to eat it ! 
I think my cat should be praised, not punished for only just licking the 
meat. It must very badly have wanted to steal it altogether! ' 

Just at that moment the cat came in, licking its lips. Nobbly flew at it, 
and gave it a hard smack, so that it mewed in dismay and fled to a corner. 

Big-Hands was very angry. He rushed at Nobbly and shook him 
but Nobbly was a bony person to shake. He had great bony feet and long 
skinny arms and a nobbly head. Big-Hands soon let him go and then 
Nobbly fled to his cottage crying " I'll pay you out for this, so I will! ' 

And he did too. He really was very naughty indeed. He threw all his 
rubbish over the wall into Big-Hands' garden. He lighted his bonfire when 

249 



BIG-HANDS AND NOBBLY 

the wind was blowing towards Big-Hands' cottage, so the poor gnome had 
his kitchen filled with smoke all day long. And he put his gramophone on 
very loudly indeed when he knew that Big-Hands was having his afternoon 
nap! 

This made the gnome very angry. He ran up the path to Nobbly's 
front-door and banged on the knocker. Nobbly wouldn't open the door, 
so Big-Hands stood on the doorstep and yelled at him. 

" I'm going to punish you for all these unkind things ! Yes, you look 
out, Nobbly! You'll be sorry for yourself, you will! I'll just show you 
what I can do! Grrrrrrr! " 

Big-Hands sounded so very fierce that Nobbly really felt rather 
frightened. Big-Hands did not usually lose his temper, for he was a good- 
natured fellow, but when he did people knew about it! 

Nobbly looked at Big-Hands going down the path, from behind the 
curtain. He saw him doubling up his big hands into fists, and shaking 
them, muttering angrily all the time. 

" Oooh ! " thought Nobbly. " I'd better be careful. There's really no 
knowing what he might do ! ' 

So that day Nobbly didn't throw any more rubbish over the wall, and 
didn't set his gramophone going. He went to bed early that night, read a 
book for a little while and then fell fast asleep. 

When he woke up, the moon was shining outside his window. And, 
to Nobbly's great fright and horror, he suddenly saw what looked like two 
enormous hands sticking up at the end of his bed, looking for all the world 
as if they belonged to someone crouching behind the foot of the bed, 
ready to pounce out! 

Nobbly turned pale and shivered so that the bed shook very much 
indeed. His hair stood up on end. 

" It's Big-Hands the Gnome come to scare me ! " he groaned to him- 
self. " Oh my, oh my, look at those awful great hands sticking up there, 
ready to come at me if I so much as speak a word." 

Now, Nobbly had made a very great mistake. What he thought 
were hands were not hands at all but simply his own great bony 
feet sticking up out of the bed-clothes! Nobbly was so bony that the 
clothes found it difficult to keep on him, and were for ever slipping 
off! 

250 



BIG-HANDS AND NOBBLY 




Nobbly lay and looked at his feet. 

Nobbly lay and looked at his feet, thinking all the time that they were 
hands, and wondering what in the world he could do to frighten away Big- 
Hands, whom he thought was hiding at the end of the bed. Then suddenly 
the moon went behind a cloud and the room became dark. Nobbly 
decided to creep out of bed and light his candle. 

He crept out, and went to the table by the wall where his candle stood. 
He lighted it and then held it up to see Big-Hands but, of course, there 
was no one at the end of the bed at all ! No not a sign of Big-Hands the 
gnome! It was most pulling! 

" He's gone ! " said Nobbly, pleased. " Oh, what a fright he gave me, 
the horrid creature ! What shall I do if he comes again to-morrow night? 
I shan't dare to go to bed! I shall go and complain to Mister Stick, the 
policeman." 

So, the next morning Nobbly went to the cottage where Mister Stick 
the policeman lived. He was just finishing his morning cup of cocoa, and 
he listened in surprise when Nobbly told him what he had seen the night 
before. 

" Yes, I tell you," said Nobbly, all excited. " That nasty, unkind 
gnome came into my room in the middle of the night, hid himself at the 
end of my bed, and then, when I woke up, I saw his big hands sticking up 
ready to come at me ! Think of that, now ! Don't you think you ought to 
go and take Big-Hands to prison? " 

251 



BIG-HANDS AND NOBBLY 




Nobbly went to the cottage where the policeman Jived. 

" Well, no, I don't," said Mister Stick. " You see, you might have 
made a mistake, Nobbly. After all, you didn't see Big-Hands' face, did 
you? It might have been anyone else." 

" Pooh! " said Nobbly, scornfully. " It couldn't have been anyone 
else! No one else has such enormous hands as Big-Hands. I know they 
must have been his hands." 

" Well, wait and see if he comes again," said Mister Stick. " I'll wait 
outside to-night, and if you give a call I'll come in and take Mister Big- 
Hands ofT to prison, if it really is him." 

:< But suppose he escapes before you come? " said Nobbly. " How 
shall I get hold of him? He is such a big fellow." 

252 



BIG-HANDS AND NOBBLY 

" Well," said Mister Stick, thinking hard, " you might take a piece of 
rope and make a loop in it, Nobbly. Then, if Big-Hands does come again 
and scares you by sticking up his great hands at the end of the bed, you 
just throw the loop of rope round them, draw it tight and you'll have 
got him prisoner all ready for me to march off! ' 

" Ooh, that's zgood idea! " said Nobbly, very pleased. He went home 
and got a piece of rope. He carefully made a loop in it and put it beside 
his bed, ready for the night. When his bed time came he undressed, got 
into bed, and put the loop of rope under his pillow. Aha, Mister Big- 
Hands, just wait! 

He fell asleep and woke again with a jump just after midnight. And 
dear me, bless us all, there were his great bony feet sticking up again in 
the moonlight, looking like enormous hands! 

" Oh, it's you, Big-Hands, again, is it! " cried Nobbly, and he fished 
under the pillow for his loop of rope. In a trice he had it out and threw 
it neatly over what he thought were the hands at the foot of the bed but 
of course they were his own feet! He pulled the loop tight, and then 
gave a scream. 

" Oh, oh, let go my feet, Big-Hands ! Oh you wicked gnome, you've 
got my feet! ' 

As the rope pulled tightly and bound his feet together poor Nobbly 
rolled about in the bed. He thought he had got hold of Big-Hands with 
the rope, so he pulled and pulled and the more he pulled the more tightly 
the rope cut into his nobbly feet! 

"Ow! Ow! Help! Help !" yelled the goblin, and rolled off the bed 
with a bump. He tried to get up, but of course his feet were tied together, 
and he fell over each time he tried. He was really dreadfully frightened. 

" Mister Stick, Mister Stick, come and help me! " he called. " Big- 
Hands has got me by the feet and won't let go! ' 

Now Mister Stick had been hiding in the garden, as he promised 
but he had fallen asleep. He woke up in a hurry when he heard such a 
yelling and shouting going on. He jumped up and at the same moment 
Big-Hands who had been awakened by the dreadful yells and shouts 
from Nobbly, rushed out of his cottage. 

" What's the matter, what's the matter ? " called Big-Hands, running 
up the path and bumping into Mister Stick the policeman, who was most 

253 



BIG-HANDS AND NOBBLY 

surprised to see him for he quite thought he must be inside Nobbly's 
cottage, frightening him! 

The two of them opened the door and ran to the stairs. Nobbly 
was still shouting and yelling, rolling about on the floor with his feet 
tied tightly together by the loop of rope. 

" Come on, quick, someone's hurting poor Nobbly! " cried Big- 
Hands, all his quarrel with the goblin quite forgotten. Up the stairs they 
rushed, both of them, and flung open the bedroom door. It was quite 
dark in the bedroom, and Mister Stick shone his lantern round. 

Nobbly was panting on the floor, pulling with all his might at his rope ! 
Mister Stick set his lantern down on a table and lifted Nobbly to his feet. 

" Someone's tied your feet together," said Big-Hands in astonish- 
ment, as he saw the loop of rope tightly round the goblin's bony feet. 
" Whoever did that? " 

" Why, wasn't ityou?" said Nobbly in amazement, staring at Big-Hands. 

" No, indeed it wasn't," answered Big-Hands at once. " I wouldn't do 
such a horrid thing ! You ought to know that. Besides, Mister Stick the 
policeman will tell you I came rushing up the stairs with him I wasn't in 
your bedroom at all. I do wonder who it was. Let's hunt round a bit and 
see if we can see any robber, shall we, Mister Stick? ' : 

They untied poor Nobbly's feet and then, taking the lantern, they all 
hunted round the cottage but, of course there was no one there at all ! 
They couldn't understand it. 

" I'm so frightened ! " wept Nobbly. " I can't make it out. Who is 
this person with great, enormous hands who keeps coming to frighten me? 
Oh, dear Big-Hands, do please stay with me for the rest of the night and 
sleep here so that I shan't be alone. Then, if the person comes again, you 
will be able to scare him away for me. You are so brave." 

" Very well," promised Big-Hands. So they said goodnight to Mister 
Stick, and off he went home. Big-Hands and Nobbly settled down to sleep 
in the bed it was rather a tight fit for two people and soon nothing was 
to be heard but gentle snores from Nobbly and enormously loud ones 
from Big-Hands. 

Well, Big-Hands suddenly gave such a tremendous snore that Nobbly 
woke up with a jump and goodness me, there were his feet again, sticking 
up in the moonlight just like big hands coming to get him. 

254 



BIG-HANDS AND NOBBLY 

" Ooh! Ow! " yeUed Nobbly, in a fright. "Wake up, Big-Hands! 
Look! Look! " 

Big-Hands woke up with a jump and sat up in the moonlight. He 
saw at once what Nobbly was looking at but he was wiser than the 
foolish goblin, and he knew that what Nobbly thought were hands, were 
really his own bony feet with the bed-clothes off! He began to laugh. 
How he laughed! 

He rolled over and over in the bed, dragging all the clothes from 
Nobbly and making him shiver with cold. 

" Ho ho ho, ha ha ha, he he he ! " yelled Big-Hands, the tears pouring 
down his cheeks. " Oh, Nobbly, you'll be the death of me, really you will! 
It's your own silly big feet looking at you, not a robber's hands at all! Oh 
my, oh my, I've such a stitch in my side ! Whatever will you do next ? " 

Well, when Nobbly looked a little closer, and waggled his toes about 
to see if the hands really were his feet, he found that Big-Hands was right 
and he went as red as a cooked beetroot! You should have seen him. He 
did feel so ashamed of himself. Whatever would Mister Stick say? And 
what would all the village say too, when it heard the tale of how Nobbly 
had been scared of his own feet and had even tied them up in a loop of 
rope, and rolled about the floor ! Oh dear ! What a dreadful silly he was, 
to be sure. 

" Oh, Nobbly, you'll be the joke of the town to-morrow! " laughed 
Big-Hands, wiping the tears of laughter from his eyes. 




Up the stairs they rushed, both of them. 



BIG-HANDS AND NOBBLY 

" Big-Hands, don't tell anyone," said Nobbly, in a small voice. 
" Please be friends with me again and don't tell anybody about this. I 
do hate to be laughed at." 

" Well, you deserve to be," said Big-Hands. " You have been very 
unkind lately, Nobbly smacking my cat, and throwing rubbish into my 
garden, and letting your bonfire smoke come into my kitchen, and playing 
your gramophone when I am trying to have a nap. You don't deserve any 
kindness from me. No I think everyone must hear this funny story 
about you. It's such a joke ! " 

" Oh please, Big-Hands, I know I've been unkind and horrid," wept 
the goblin. " But I won't be again. I do want to be friends with you. You 
were so kind to stay with me to-night. I will buy your cat a nice fresh fish 
from the fishman each day for a fortnight if you will forgive me, and 
promise not to tell anyone at all." 

" Well, that's a kind thought of yours," said Big-Hands, who was 
always pleased when anyone was good to his cat. ' ( I'll forgive you and 
be friends again, then, Nobbly. But you won't mind if I have a good laugh 
now and again, will you, when I think about to-night? For really it was 
very, very funny! ' 

So now the two are great friends once more, and Big-Hands' cat 
can't understand her good luck when she is given a fish each day by 
Nobbly the goblin! 

And, sometimes, when Nobbly is a bit silly and does foolish things, 
Big-Hands looks at him with a twinkle in his eye, and begins to laugh. 
" Do you remember when you caught your own feet instead of a robber?" 
he chuckles. Then Nobbly goes red, and stops being silly. He does so 
hate to be reminded of the night when he thought his feet were hands !

Let's Make Some 
Lanterns for Xmas! 



How can we make one? I'll tell you! 
Get a piece of coloured paper, and 
make it 9 inches wide and 12 inches long by 
measuring it and then cutting it the right size. 

Now fold it as I have shown you in Pic- 
ture A. Done that? Now cut up from the 
folded edge in strips about J inch wide. Look 
at Picture B to see what I mean. 

Now you have cut the paper. Straighten 
it out: Bend it round and paste the edges 
together, and lo and behold you have a pretty 
little coloured lantern, like the one shown in 
Picture C. You can make the handle by 
pasting a strip of paper to the top. 

Now make one of another shape. Look 
at Picture D and fold the paper like that. Cut 
the strips as before. Do you see the little extra 
fold, which gives the second lantern (Picture 
E) its pretty middle bit? 

You can easily make these little lanterns 
for Christmas decorations. Hang them on a 
string, and see how pretty they all look to- 
gether !

THE children were playing out in the fields. They had a ball, a doll's 
pram, and Joey, a little clockwork clown who danced round and 
round and clashed a little pair of cymbals when he was wound up. 

The clockwork clown belonged to Robin. He was very proud of his 
dancing clown, and wound him up a hundred times a day to show the 
others how he danced. 

Every one was excited that morning. It was Saturday, and a circus 
had come to the field beyond Farmer Lane's farm. The children were going 
to it that afternoon, and how they longed for the time to come! 

" There is a wonderful chimpanzee ! " said Katie. 

" And a great big elephant," said Lucy. 

" And a man that can walk the tight-rope! " said Bobby. 

" And four dancing bears ! " said Harry. 

" But I'm sure they won't dance as well as my clockwork clown! * 
said Robin, winding him up again, and making him dance in the grass. 

"You and your clockwork clown! " said Katie. "I wonder you 
don't wear that key out, winding him up so much! ' 

Robin put the key into his pocket. He was sure it wouldn't wear out. 
Keys never'did. He watched his little clown dancing, and then he went to 
see an ant-hill that Harry had found. They watched the busy little ants for 
a long time, and then Bobby looked at his watch. He was very proud of 
it, for it always told the right time. 

" Half-past two," he said. " It's time we all went home, and got 

258 



JOEY'S LOST KEY 

ready for the circus. Come along ! " 
" I must wind up my clock- 
work clown to dance for the last 
time," said Robin, and he felt in 
his pocket for the key. 

It wasn't there ! He felt a hole 
in his pocket and he knew that 
the key must have dropped out of 
it. Now the little clown wouldn't 
be able to dance any more! 

Robin was only six, and he 
was dreadfully upset. He opened 
his mouth and howled. Lucy ran 
up to him, thinking that he had 
hurt himself. 

'' Fve lost my clown's key! 
I've lost his key! " wept Robin. 
" I won't go home till I've found 
it." 

:< But you must! " said Lucy. 
" Why, it's almost time to set off for the circus, Robin and you must wash 
your face and hands first, and let your mother brush your hair." 

" I won't go to the circus ! " wept Robin. " I'll stay here all afternoon 
by myself and look for my clown's key." 

" You're silly, Robin," said Harry. " Come on, every one. Leave 
Robin. He'll come along soon enough when he finds we're gone." 

So Harry, Bobby, and Katie ran off, but Lucy didn't really like to leave 
poor Robin when he was so unhappy. She was a kind little girl. 

" Don't cry any more, Robin," she said. " I'll help you to look for 
your key. Hurry up and help me." 

So the two of them began to hunt in the grass, but, dear me, it seemed 
as if that key was nowhere to be found ! Lucy began to be worried, for the 
time was slipping on, and she knew that she couldn't go to the circus if 
she was much later. 

" Robin, let's go now," she said. " Come along. We shall be too 
late for the circus in a minute." 




He felt in his pocket for the key. 



259 




JOEY'S LOST KEY 

But Robin wouldn't go. He 
stood there, clutching his clock- 
work clown in one hand and 
wiping his eyes with the other. He 
didn't care about anything except 
finding his lost key. 

"Oh, well! " said Lucy. "If 
you won't come I'll stay with you 
but I do hope we find the key 
soon! " 

In a little while the other chil- 
dren ran out of their houses down 
the lane, waved to Lucy, and went 
off to the circus. Tears came into 
the little girl's eyes. Now she was 
too late to go ! She went down on 
her hands and knees again and 
looked carefully for that tiresome 
key. 

And what do you think she found? She found a four-leaved clover ! 
Now, as you know, a four-leaved clover is supposed to be very lucky 
indeed, for it has magic in it! Lucy and the other children had often 
hunted for one, and had never found one and now here was a fine one, 
with four green leaves, a really-and-truly four-leaved clover! 

"Look, Robin! " said Lucy joyfully. "I've found a four-leaved 
clover! Now 1 shall have some luck! ' 

" It's too late to be lucky," said Robin. " We've missed the circus 
now and haven't found my key." 

" Why, here's the key, under this dandelion! " cried Lucy. And so 
it was! '' My four-leaved clover has brought us luck already! " 
" But it's too late for the circus," said Robin again. 
" Hurry, and we'll see ! " said Lucy. So they hurried. Robin went to 
his home and Lucy went to hers. And it was too late for Lucy; but do 
you know, when Robin told his father how kind Lucy had been to him, 
he jumped up and said: 

" Well, that kind little girl shan't miss the circus ! I'll get out 

260 



I've found a four-leaved clover. 



JOEY'S LOST KEY 

the van and run both of you along to the circus straightaway. Then you'll 
be in time." 

So he got out the van in which he took his fruit to the market, called 
for Lucy, popped her in with Robin and tore down the lane to the circus. 
He paid for Lucy's ticket as well as Robin's, and they were given two good 
seats. They sat down just as the circus began! Wasn't that lucky? 

It was a lovely circus, and when the clown came in to give away 
balloons, who do you suppose got the biggest? Yes, Lucy ! And when the

suppose he gave a hug to? Yes, Lucy! Didn't she feel proud !

girl happily. " I'm glad I stayed 
behind to help Robin." 

On the way home Lucy found 
a silver sixpence ! Wasn't that good 
luck! And when she got home, 
there was her Uncle Jim, her very 
favourite uncle, come to take her out 
to tea with him in his motor-car. 

"Oh, Uncle Jim! This is all 
because of my four-leaved clover ! ' : 
said Lucy happily. " Where are 
we going? " 

" We're going to the town 
to have tea and ice-creams," said 
Uncle Jim. " And then we're 
going to an old man I know who 
has a dear little puppy for sale, and 
I want to buy it for a nice little 
girl called Lucy." 
squealed Lucy, who wanted a puppy more than anything 




It was a little black spaniel. 



Uncle! 



else in the world. ' Uncle! You dear kind uncle! ' 

Well, she had a lovely tea and two ice-creams, and then they went to 
fetch the puppy. It was a little black spaniel, with long, drooping ears, 
the dearest little thing Lucy had ever seen. 

" What will you call her? " asked Uncle Jim as they drove back in his 
car, with Lucy cuddling the puppy, feeling very sleepy and very happy. 

Lucy had a name for her, of course. Can you guess what it was? It 
was Clover! Lucy thought it would be such a lucky name. 

Didn't she have a lot of luck? Do you want some as well? Well, just 
hunt about for a four-leaved clover and maybe you'll have some too.

ONCE there W^LS a humming top who was very proud indeed of hum- 
ming and spinning. He spun himself round all day long till the 
other toys got quite giddy with watching him. He hummed all the time, 
too. " Zoooooooooooom ! " he sang. " Zooooooooooooom ! ' 

" Do stop," said the baby doll. " I'm tired of hearing you." 

" Yes, lie down and have a rest," said the wooden soldier. " You 
make me tired." 

" You are jealous of me because I can spin and hum and none of 
you can do the same! " sang the top, zooming even more loudly. " I 
shall run away from you. You are selfish, stupid toys! I shall go out 
into the big world and hum and spin all I like." 

" Go then," said the wooden soldier. " You'll be sorry. It isn't 
often that toys have a beautiful nursery like this to live in, and a kind 
little girl like Katie to play with us." 

The top spun round quickly. " Zooooooom! " it said. " There are 
better things than this! Good-bye! " 

It spun itself out of the nursery and down the stairs and out of 
the back door and down the garden path and into the road! 
'* Zooooooooooooom! " it went. 

It met a duck waddling along. The duck stared in surprise. 
" Zooooooooom! " said the top. " I'm a wonder, I am! See me spin! 
Hear me hum! Zoooooom! Can you do that, duck? ' 

" Quack! " said the duck. " No, I've never seen any one like you 
before. I don't like you." The duck pecked at the top and it almost lost 

263 



THE TOP THAT RAN AWAY 

its balance and fell. It zoomed angrily and spun away down the lane. 
Soon it met a kitten chasing a piece of paper. 

" Zooooooooom !" said the top. " I'm a wonder, I am! See me 
spin! Hear me hum! Zoooom! Can you do that? ' 

" Miaow! " said the kitten in alarm. " No, I can't go round like 
that it's silly. And why should I hum if I can mew? Get off my piece 
of paper. I'm playing with it." 

The top spun round on the paper and wouldn't get off. The kitten 
crouched and sprang. Her claws scratched the shining top and made 
marks on it. The top spun crooked and zoomed crossly. It spun away 
from the kitten and went on its way. 




Then it met a big cow. 
264 



THE TOP THAT RAN AWAY 

Then it met a big cow and spun between its feet. 

" Zoooooooooom ! " said the top. :c I'm a wonder, I am! See me 
spin! Hear me hum! Zooooom! Can you do that? ' 

" Moo! " said the cow in surprise. " Of course not. What do you 
suppose the farmer would say if I began to spin round on one leg and 
make a noise like a young aeroplane? Get away from my feet. You'll 
trip me up." 

The top wouldn't get away. It went proudly spinning and zooming. 
The cow kicked it. What a shock for the top ! It almost stopped spinning 
and very nearly fell over. But it just saved itself and then went on down 
the lane, still zooming at the top of its voice. 

The next creature it met was a worm, and the top spun right up 
to it. 

" Zoooom! " said the top. " I'm a wonder, I am! See me spin! 
Hear me hum! Zooooom! Can you do that? ' 

" No," said the worm in fright. " And I don't want to either. If I 
spun round like that, all the birds of the air would see me and come 
flying down to get me. And no worm would make a terrible noise like 
that! Oooooh! Don't spin on me, top you're hurting me! ' 

The top was most unkindly spinning on the worm's tail. The worm 
wriggled free, and shot down its hole at top speed. The top was pleased. 
My, what a grand time it was having, spinning and frightening every one 
out in the big world! 

Soon the top came to where a large spider was talking to a bumble- 
bee. 

" Zooooooom! " said the top. " I'm a wonder, I am. See me spin! 
Hear me hum! Zooooom! Can you do that? ' 

" I can hum," said the bumble-bee quietly. 

" And I can spin," said the spider, looking at the top with her eight 
eyes. " Don't spoil my web, top." 

But the top did spoil it. It spun into it and broke it. The spider said 
nothing. " You are not telling the truth," said the top rudely. " You 
cannot spin! No one but a humming-top can spin! I'm a wonder, I am." 

* Stay here for the night and I will show you how I and my family 
can spin," said the spider. " Bumble-bee, go and fetch all my family the 
biggest you can find." 

265 



THE TOP THAT RAN AWAY 

The bumble-bee flew off, zooming through the air just like a big 
humming-top. Soon he was back and hurrying over the ground below 
him came twenty big garden-spiders. 

" Now we will show you how we spin," said the spider. " Bumble- 
bee, sing us a tune for very soon the top will cease to hum. Sisters, 
begin your work! Spin well! ' 

The top hummed angrily and more loudly than ever as it spun round 
and round among the long-legged spiders. Quietly they began to spin out 
their silken threads. The wind took the threads into the air and wound 
them round the spinning top. More and more threads floated out from the 
spiders' bodies. More and more quickly they spun them. Soon hundreds 
of strong silky threads were fastened around the top. 

It began to find it difficult to spin so fast. The threads pulled against 
it. The top spun slowly and more slowly and yet more slowly ! Its voice 
became fainter. The bee's loud hum could be heard above its own faint 
zoom. 

" What are you doing what are you doing? " hummed the top faintly. 

" We are spinning, spinning, spinning," said the spider. " Not quite 
your kind of spinning, perhaps but spinning all the same. We are spin- 
ning threads that will stop jour spinning, proud and haughty top! Ah! 
Others can spin and hum, you see! ' 

The top wobbled and wobbled and stopped. It fell over on its 
side. It could not spin any longer, for the spiders' threads held it too 
tightly. The bumble-bee hummed in joy. 




Soon hundreds of strong silky threads were fastened around the top. 

266 



THE TOP THAT RAN AWAY 

The spiders laughed among themselves and hurried away to spin big 
webs to catch flies for their dinner. The bumble-bee flew off to his hole 
in the bank. The top was left on the ground alone. 

It began to rain. The pelting raindrops washed some of the bright 
paint off the top. It groaned to itself. :< I shall get rusty now ! Oh, why 
did I leave the nursery? Why was I so vain? I wish I was back! I wish 
I was back! ' 

Well the top got its wish for not long after that, who should come 
by but Katie herself, going home after school. She saw her top lying in the 
rain, and she picked it up in surprise. The rain had washed the webs away. 
Katie did not know that the top had been fastened down by them. She 
could not understand how the top had got there. 

" Who took you out here, poor old top? " she said. " The rain will 

spoil you. I will take you in." 

So the top got back to its own 
nursery and the toys stared in 
astonishment. The top lay down 
in the cupboard quite quietly. It 
didn't spin. It didn't hum. 

" What's the matter with 
you? " asked the baby doll. 

" Oh, I met other people in 
the big world who could spin and 

said 



hum better than I could,' 
the top. " That's all." 

The toys never knew who the 
top had met. I expect you 
wonder how I know. Well, 
perhaps I heard the bumble-bee 
telling the foxgloves in my 
garden. 

" Who took you out here, poor old top ? "

Can You Do These? 



HERE'S a little puzzle for you. See if you can do 
it. Take seventeen matches (dead ones are 
best) and arrange them to make six squares, as I have 
shown you in this picture. 

Now I want you to take away five matches and 
leave three perfect squares. Can you do it? 




Here's Another 

There was once a man who had four children. In a square orchard 
he had twenty-four cherry-trees growing. He told his children they 
could divide the orchard into four equal pieces, each having six trees. 
They managed to do it but how? 

Here is the orchard with the trees growing in it. With a pencil 
see if you can lightly divide it up into equal parts but remember that 
each part must have six cherry-trees in it!

CHRISTMAS- 




FAIRY 



ONCE upon a time old Dame Trit-trot went to market and bought a big 
spray of holly berries to make her house pretty. And when she 
got home, what did she find fast asleep in the middle of the prickly spray, 
but a small fairy, wrapped in a cobweb blanket! 

Now Dame Trit-trot did not believe in fairies at all, so, of course, 
she did not think this was a fairy. 

" It's a doll! " she said. " How queer! Well, I never saw such a dainty 
little doll before! It will do for my grand-daughter Jane." 

So she wrapped the fairy in white tissue-paper and put her in a card- 
board box. She took it to Jane the next day, and Jane opened the box and 
unwrapped the tissue-paper. 

Jane's mother peeped into the box and saw the sleeping fairy there. 
*' Oh! " she cried, " what a beautiful little doll! It has wings like a fairy." 

:e It is a fairy," said Jane, who believed in fairies, and knew one when 
she saw one. 

" Don't be silly, darling," said her mother. " There are no such 
things as fairies! " 

" But, Mother, this is a real live one! " cried Jane. " It is, it is! Look 
at her wings! Look at her tiny little nails! " 

" What funny things children say! " said Granny Trit-trot. So Jane 
said no more. But she knew quite well that the doll was a real live fairy, 
fast asleep. 

She carried the box away to her nursery and took out the sleeping fairy 
very carefully. She put her into her doll's bed and covered her up well. 

269 



THE CHRISTMAS-TREE FAIRY 

How lovely the fairy looked, lying in the tiny bed, her golden hair fluffed 
out on the little pillow, and one of her small hands outside the sheet. Jane 
was so happy and excited. When would the fairy wake up? 

" Jane, Jane! Here's John come to see you! " Mother called up the 
stairs and Jane heard John running up. She ran to meet him, her face 
red with excitement. 

" John! Come here! I've got a real live fairy asleep in my doll's 
bed! Look! " 

She took John to the bed and he looked down at the sleeping fairy. 
Then he laughed. "That's only a doll! " he said. "I don't believe 
in fairies, Jane. That's a doll you can't make me believe it's a 
fairy! " 

" But look at her silvery wings peeping out of the bedclothes ! ' 
said Jane. " Look at her beautiful hair ! Besides, she is alive. Don't you 
see her pink cheeks? " 

" It's just a Christmas-tree fairy doll," said John. " I tell you, I don't 
believe in fairies! " 

Jane said no more. She knew that Angela, her friend, believed in 
fairies, so that afternoon she made 
Angela come in from her walk and 
see the doll. 

" Jane ! It's a real live fairy ! " 
said Angela, in delight. " Oh, 
Jane, how lucky you are! How 
lucky! " 

" Isn't it funny, Angela, 
people who don't believe in fairies 
think she's just a doll," said Jane. 
" So they only see a doll lying 
there but you and I, who do 
believe in fairies, can see quite well 
that she is really a sleeping fairy! 
Oh, I do wonder when she will 
wake up!" 

Every day Jane went to the 

doll's bed to see if the fairy had Every day Jane went to the doll's bed.

THE CHRISTMAS-TREE FAIRY 

awakened but not until the day of the Christmas party came did the 
little fairy open her eyes! She had had such a long sleep! How sur- 
prised she was to find herself tucked up cosily in a soft little bed ! 

" Oh! " cried Jane, when she saw the fairy sit up and rub her eyes. 
' ( I knew you were a fairy, and not a doll ! ' 

The two talked together, and Jane told the fairy that her mother had 
said it would be nice to put the fairy at the top of the Christma.s-.tree that 
evening. " You see, Mother thinks you are only a fairy doll," said Jane. 
" She doesn't believe in fairies. Will you mind standing at the top of the 
tree, fairy? " 

" Not a bit," said the fairy. " And I'll give each child who believes 
in me a wish to wish one that will come true ! So you must tell all those 
who don't believe in fairies to go but of the room, Jane and I will fly 
down and hear every child's wish. And then, dear Jane, I must fly away. 
This is a dear soft little bed, but I have my own home, you know. I will 
often come and see you again." 

" Sh! " said Jane. " Here comes Mother." 

Jane's mother carried the fairy doll to the Christmas-tree and put her 
at the top. How pretty she looked there! 

"It's the loveliest fairy doll I've ever seen! " said Mother. 

In the middle of the party, when the Christmas-tree was shining with 
candles, Jane clapped her hands and made every one quiet. 

" Please, will you do something for me? " she said. " Will every 
one who doesn't believe in fairies go out of the room and all those who 
do believe in them stay here with me? I have a secret to show to them ! ' 

All the grown-ups except Aunt Susan and Mary, the little housemaid, 
went out. Two little girls and three boys went out too. Alan, Mollie, 
Angela, Trixie, Jack, and Jane were left. 

" I know your secret ! " cried Jack. " It's the doll up there ! She's 
a Christmas-tree fairy a real live one! I saw her smiling at us just now! " 

e Yes that's my secret," said Jane. " She is going to fly down to 
each of you and give you a wish. Keep still and think hard what you would 
like most! " 

Each child stood still and the little fairy flew down on her silvery 
wings. She listened to every child's wish and nodded her golden head. 
"It will come true! " she said. 

271 



THE CHRISTMAS-TREE FAIRY 




The little fairy flew down on her silvery wings. 

And then she flew out of the window and disappeared into the dark 
night. " She has gone back to her home," said Jane. 

When the other children and grown-ups came back, they were sur- 
prised to see no doll at the top of the Christmas-tree! " Where is she? v 
they cried. 

" She has flown out of the window! " said Jane. 

But, you know, they didn't believe her. Do tell me would you 
have been outside the door or /#side if you had been at Jane's Christmas 
party?

A Little Weather Girl 

DO you know how to make a weather girl who will tell you if the 
weather is going to be wet or fine? 

You want a fir-cone, a nice round oak-apple, a flat bit of cork, an 
acorn-cup, and a few short twigs. 

Now look at my picture. Can you make a girl like that ! Her body is 
the fir-cone, and the frills of her dress are the scales of the cone. 

Her head is an oak-apple. You must draw her face yourself. Her hat 

is your acorn-cup. If you want her 
to have hair, get some wool from 
Mother, and cut it into a lot of short 
pieces. Glue them on her head and 
pop the hat on top. She will look 
very funny. 

The twigs are for arms and legs. 
You may have to make holes to push 
the twigs into, but if you sharpen the 
ends of the twigs, it will be easy. 

Now run the leg-twigs into a 
flat cork, for a stand. (Sharpen the 
ends first.) There's your weather- 
girl! 

She will expand or ruffle out 
her skirts if the weather is fine, but 
will close up the ruffles if it is wet. 
Isn't she clever?

The Tiresome Brownie 

EVERY year the brownies of Heyho Village held a meeting to decide 
all kinds of things whether a new lamp-post was needed in 
the village if they should build a new village-hall and what to give the 
policeman when he had finished his twenty years of looking after Heyho. 

" This year there are such a lot of things to talk about," said Bron, 
the chief brownie. " It's a pity that that tiresome old brownie, Mister 
Slowcoach, should have to come. He takes about an hour to look at even 
one paper, and it makes the meeting so long! ' 

" Last year we didn't get home till midnight," said Fiddle. " All 
because Mister Slowcoach kept asking the silliest questions all the time." 

" Well, this year we shan't get home at all, it seems to me," said Bron, 
looking at the things they had to talk about at the meeting. " It will 
take Slowcoach quite twelve hours to think about everything." 

" Need we have him at the meeting? " asked Jinks impatiently. 

" I'm afraid we must," said Bron. " He's always been, and he 
always expects to come." 

Fiddle thought it was a great nuisance. He went away and thought 
about it and by and by a grin came over his merry face. He had thought 
of an idea! 

It was Fiddle's job to choose the meeting-place somewhere out-of- 
doors, and find comfortable rocks or stones to sit on, or grow a ring of 

274 



THE TIRESOME BROWNIE 

mushrooms. This year he went to a grassy dell he knew, where many 
big rounded stones lay that would make good seats. Fiddle arranged 

them in a neat ring. 

But there was one gap in the ring ! Fiddle grinned to himself and 
went to call on Crawler the Tortoise, who lived by himself at the bottom 

of a hollow tree. 

" Crawler," he said, " will you do something for me? Pretend that 
you are a nice rock at our meeting. Then, when old Slowcoach, who 

will be sitting on you, begins to read a paper to himself, just walk quietly 

off with him, will you? We can finish our meeting without him then, 
and get home early." 

Crawler chuckled. " I'll do it! " he said. So when the evening came 
for the meeting, the tortoise set himself down in the ring of stones and 
lay there with his head well-tucked into his shell, waiting. 

Fiddle showed the brownies to their seats when the meeting began. 
He made quite sure that Mister Slowcoach sat on the tortoise. How he 
smiled when he thought of what would happen! 

The meeting began. Bron stood up and talked about all that had 
happened in Heyho the last year, and papers were given out for every 
one to look at. Mister Slowcoach took his, and put his big spectacles 
on. He opened his paper. 

" Go on, Crawler," whispered Fiddle. ;< It's a good time now, when 
every one is reading! ' 

Carefully the tortoise began to crawl out of the ring. He went so 
slowly that Mister Slowcoach didn't even feel any movement. When 
Bron the chief brownie looked up, he was most surprised to see that 
Mister Slowcoach was right outside the ring, reading his paper with his 
nose deep in the sheets. 

" Dear me," said Bron in surprise and displeasure, :< I suppose 
Mister Slowcoach doesn't like being in the ring with us! He's gone to 
sit on another stone outside. I suppose he thinks we might interrupt 
his reading." 

All the brownies snorted. They were vexed. 

" Never mind old Slowcoach," said naughty Fiddle. " He's quite 
happy there. Don't disturb him." 

So nobody said a word to him, and the meeting went on, whilst old 



THE TIRESOME BROWNIE 

Slowcoach still sat and read the paper slowly. Crawler the tortoise 
waited till the brownies were eagerly talking about a new seat they 
meant to put at the end of the village, and then he walked off a few 
more steps and stopped again. 

Soon Bron noticed that Mister Slowcoach was even farther away, 
and he was still more vexed. 

" I suppose the noise of our talking disturbed him and he went to 
sit on a stone much farther off," he said, annoyed. " Well, let him! Get 
on with the meeting! " 

So they held the rest of the meeting without Slowcoach, and little by 
little the tortoise took him away until at last, when Slowcoach had

" Oh! " he cried in a rage, " what is this? Here I've been sitting still 
and studying the papers, and all the brownies have crept away from me to 
hold their meeting somewhere else! The rascals! The rogues! I will 
never go to their meeting again, or help them with my advice! ' 

So he didn't and every one was pleased. But nobody could imagine 
why Slowcoach kept saying that the brownies had run away and left him 
alone. 

" It was you that went away from usl " said Bron. " Every time we 
looked at you, you had gone a little farther away ! ' 

"Indeed I hadn't! " grumbled Slowcoach. "I was sitting on a 
stone and stones don't walk, do they? ' 

" No! " whispered naughty Fiddle to Crawler; " stones don't walk 
but tortoises do! "

^ I ^HERE was once a poor old Teddy Bear who belonged to a little girl 
A called Joan. She didn't treat him very well, for she had pulled out 
an eye, and made one of his arms loose. She often left him out in the rain, 
so he looked very dirty, and always had a cold. 

The other toys thought him a dirty, sniffy old creature, and they 
wouldn't let him live in the toy cupboard with them. 

" No, get away, Teddy," said the big doll, pushing him out. " We 
shall catch your cold." 

So the teddy meekly sat by the window alone and wished he had a 
handkerchief. The baby doll had one in her pocket, but he knew she 
wouldn't lend it to him. 

Now one autumn day Joan took her toys out into the garden and 
sat them on the seat. She played school with them, and pretended that 
the teddy was very naughty indeed. 

" You are the only toy that is not listening to your lessons ! " she 
said to him. " You are very naughty. Go into the corner." 

So the teddy had to stand down and turn his face to the bushes in the 
corner. He didn't really mind much, because, you see, he knew it was 
pretending. But what he did mind a great deal was being forgotten 
afterwards ! 

When the time came for Joan to take in her toys she forgot all about 
the teddy. She gathered up the toys on the seat, and took them indoors 
into the warmth and brightness of the nursery. But poor old Teddy was 

278 



THE POOR OLD TEDDY 



left standing out there in the dark 
and cold. He was very lonely and 
miserable. 

He stood there until he was 
almost frozen. The frost came and 
pinched his toes. He shivered and 
shook, and began to sneeze. 
"A-tishoo! A-tishoo! " 
Nobody was about. Nobody 
heard him. He shook himself, and 
walked about to get warm. It was 
very dark, and as he only had one 
eye to see with, he kept bumping 
into things. So altogether he was 
very miserable. He did wish he 
could meet a kind-hearted fairy, 
but as Joan didn't believe in fairies, 
there were none in her garden at 
all. 




It was the dog's kennel. 



Teddy wandered about, and at last bumped into something hard and 
wooden. It was the dog's kennel! Sandy was inside, keeping himself 
warm in the straw. He woke up when he heard Teddy bumping into his 
kennel, and growled. Teddy trembled, and kept quite still. 

Sandy ran out and sniffed around. He found the teddy and smelt him 
all over. He was puzzled. 

" You are not a real animal," he said. " Are you a toy? If you are, 
why are you not in the nursery? Why are you wandering about alone 
like this in the garden? J: 

" I am a toy," said the teddy. " I belong to Joan, but she left me out 
when she took the others in. I was so cold that I was walking about to 
get myself warm. I'm sorry I woke you up." 

" Oh, so you belong to Joan, do you? " said Sandy " Well, so do 
I, and I don't like it. Do you know, she sometimes forgets to give me fresh 
water in the morning? And look at my water now! Frozen hard! She 
won't notice in the morning that my water is frozen, and maybe I'll have 
nothing to drink to-morrow. Sometimes she forgets to give me biscuits, 

279 



THE POOR OLD TEDDY 

too, and often I don't get off my chain in the morning for a run if she's 
playing with her toys, and doesn't want to bother to take me for a walk." 
" A-tishoo ! " said the bear. " I'm very sorry to hear what you . . . 
a-//.rhoo, a-//J"hoo what you have to ... a-tishoo ! Do excuse me, I can't 
seem to stop sneezing, a-tishoo! ' 

" What a dreadful cold you have," said Sandy. " Come into my 
kennel and get warm." 

" Oh, thank you so much," said the teddy gratefully. He crept into 
the kennel and snuggled down in the straw. How warm it was! He 

cuddled up against Sandy. The 
dog liked it. It was nice to feel the 
teddy's little body snuggling into 
him. 

" When I'm warm I'll fetch 
you some fresh water from the tap, 
if you like," said Teddy. " I know 
where the garden tap is, and I can 
just reach it." 

" That's very good of you," 
said Sandy. " But don't bother 
to-night; I'm not at all thirsty." 

Teddy fell asleep. He slept 
peacefully, for he was warm and 
cosy. Sandy slept too. Neither 
of them awoke until the morning. 
Then Teddy sat up, rubbed his one 
eye, and looked around him in 
surprise. Wherever was he? 

" Oh, of course, I'm in 
Sandy's kennel! " he said to himself. " And how much better my cold 
is! This warm kennel has almost sent it away." 

" Hallo, Teddy ! " said Sandy. " So you are still there ! I wondered 
if I had dreamt you." 

" No, it was real," said Teddy. " Well, Sandy, thank you very much 
for letting me sleep with you. I suppose I'd better go back into the garden 
now and hope that Joan will remember me, and fetch me in." 

280 




He crept into the kennel and snuggled 
down. 



THE POOR OLD TEDDY 

" I don't see why you should go back to Joan at all," said Sandy. 
<e Why not live with me here, in my kennel? There is plenty of room for 
both of us. I could keep you warm and play with you, and you could 
fetch me water or biscuits if Joan forgets them." 

" Yes, and I could undo your chain at night so that you could go for 
a run, if Joan doesn't take you out for a walk each day! " said the teddy, 
in excitement. " I could help you a lot, Sandy! ' 

" Well, let's do it then," said Sandy, giving the bear a lick on his nose. 
** I'd love to have you living with me. You're a nice little bear. Joan can't 
want you or love you if she leaves you out in the garden. She can just 
go without you! ' 

So the bear stayed in the kennel and didn't go out into the garden at 
all. Joan didn't remember him, so no one looked for him. When night 
came, the bear made his way out of the kennel, and said, " Sandy, Joan 
didn't give you fresh water, so I am going to get you some. You must 
be very thirsty. This has been frozen all day. You have had nothing to 
drink." 

The teddy took a stone and cracked the 
ice in the drinking bowl. Then he emptied it 
all out and carried the bowl to the tap. It was 
heavy for him, but he managed it. He turned 
on the tap, and let some water run into the 
bowl. Then he turned off the tap and carried 
the bowl back carefully to the kennel. How 
glad Sandy was to have a good long drink ! He 
had plenty of biscuits and a bone, for Joan had 
remembered those; but she hadn't taken him 
for a run, and he was longing to stretch his legs. 

" I'll undo your chain now," said Teddy. 
He found it hard to undo at first, for he 
didn't know how to, but at last he managed it, 
and off went Sandy into the night, racing round 
and round the garden in delight. It was good 
to stretch his legs when he had been still all 
day! 

Sandy raced back to the kennel. " Get on

He carried the bowl 
carefully. 



THE POOR OLD TEDDY 

my back, and I'll give you a ride," he said. So the teddy climbed up, and 
held on tightly to Sandy's collar. Off they went, the bear grunting in 
delight. He had never in his life had such an exciting time before! 

The two slept together peacefully. Teddy cuddled between Sandy's 
front paws, and Sandy rested his head on the bear's chest. They were very 
good friends indeed. 

Joan did look for Teddy, but she couldn't find him ! She didn't think 
of looking in Sandy's kennel, of course ! And anyway, Sandy said he would 
lie on top of Teddy and hide him if Joan did think of peeping in ! 

They still live together, and Teddy gives Sandy biscuits and water 
when Joan forgets, and undoes his chain every night. As for Teddy, he 
never has a cold now, and he is as happy as can be because somebody 
loves him and wants him. I'd love to see him peeping out of Sandy's 
kennel, wouldn't you? He hopes you won't tell Joan his secret if you 
know her! 







She didn't think of looking in Sandy's kennel.

Chocolate Nuts 

NUTS and chocolate go very well indeed together, don't 
they? Perhaps Mother will let you make some 
Chocolate Nuts, if you ask her, and tell her exactly how you 
mean to do it. 

First you must get your nuts. Go to the hazel woods in 
the autumn, one fine Saturday, and look for nuts. Pick some 
[ ([) 5 and take them home. Shell them, and set them ready. Put a 
sheet of grease-proof paper just nearby. 

Now get a bar of plain chocolate and cut it up into 
small pieces. Is that done? Ask Mother for an earthenware 
jam-jar. Put the chocolate into it. (See that the jar is quite 
clean.) Now stand the jar, very carefully so as not to scald 
yourself, in a saucepan of boiling water. 

You will see the chocolate beginning to melt. Stir it 
well with a spoon, and ask Mother please to lift the saucepan 
to the kitchen table for you. 

Now, with a hat-pin, spear a hazel nut and dip it quickly 
into the chocolate, turn it about a little, and then lift out. It 
will come out covered with the liquid chocolate, which will 
harden very fast. Pop the chocolate-covered nut on to the 
grease-proof paper, then dip in another nut, speared on the 
end of the hat-pin. 

You will soon have a dish of most delicious home- 
made-nut-chocolates ! But do be careful not to scald 
yourself, won't you?

The Twiddley-Hen's Egg 

ONCE upon a time Sneaky the gnome found a twiddley-hen' s egg. A 
twiddley-hen is a curious bird that wanders about and lays eggs in 
strange places. It is like a brown hen, but has a green beak, and six long 
green feathers in its tail. 

Now, whoever eats the egg of a twiddley-hen turns green in the 
face so you can guess that twiddley-eggs are not sold in the shops. The 
twiddley-hen always warns people of her eggs by marking them with a 
little green star at one end. Then people know they are her eggs and 
don't eat them. 

Now when Sneaky found the egg of a twiddley-hen he was pleased. 
He knew it was a twiddley-egg because he saw the green star marked at 
one end. Sneaky put the egg into his pocket. Except for the green star 
it was just exactly like the egg of an ordinary hen, but a bit larger. 

" I'll rub the green star ofT, and then give the egg to Dame Slap," 
thought Sneaky to himself. " She slapped me twice last week, and I'd 
like to pay her back, the mean old thing! Ho, ho! Won't it be funny 
to see her turn green in the face! ' 

When he got home he rubbed off the green star, wrapped the egg up 
carefully in tissue paper, and took it to Dame Slap's house. He sent it 
in to her with his best wishes. Then he went home, grinning all over his 
horrid little face.

THE TWIDDLEY-HEN'S EGG

Dame Slap was surprised to have an egg from Sneaky. : * Dear me! 
she said. " He must be nicer than I thought. What a nice large egg, too ! 
It must be an extra special one, laid by his hens. What a pity I have so 
many eggs to-day." 

She put it in her larder. Presently old Mister Snooks came to the door 
and brought her a bunch of flowers from his garden. Dame Slap wondered 
what to give him in return. She remembered the egg that Sneaky had 
given her. 

" I'll let old Snooks have it," she said. " It will make him a nice 
breakfast and, really, I've so many eggs to-day I can well spare him 
that one." 

So she gave the twiddley-egg to Mister Snooks and he thanked her 
and went off. On the way he called to see how the pixie Little-toes was, 
because she had been ill. The small brown mouse who came to the door 
said that Little-toes was much better. 

Mister Snooks was sorry he had no flowers to send in to Little-toes. 
But he suddenly remembered the big brown egg that Dame Slap had given 
him. That would be just the thing for the pixie's breakfast. So he gave 
it to the mouse and went oflf home. 

Little-toes thought it was very sweet of old Mister Snooks to 
send her an egg. " But, oh dear, what a pity, the doctor says I mustn't 
have eggs for a week," she said. :c So what shall I do with it, brown 
mouse? ' : 

" Why not send it to Mrs. Chinks," said the mouse. " She might be 
very glad of it. She is baking to-morrow, I know, and could use the egg 
in a cake." 

" Oh, that's a good idea! " said Little-toes, pleased. " Take it in 
this afternoon when you go home, brown mouse." 

So the brown mouse slipped in at Mrs. Chink's on her way home. 
" You can use it in your baking to-morrow," she said. Mrs. Chinks 
thanked her very much. 

Now Mrs. Chinks was Sneaky's aunt. She wasn't very fond of Sneaky, 
for she thought him a mean and deceitful gnome. But she always remem- 
bered him at Christmas-time and Easter-time and on his birthday, too. 

" To-morrow is Sneaky's birthday," she thought suddenly. " And, 
dear me, I haven't bought him a present. What shall I do? Oh I know! 

285 



THE TWIDDLEY-HEN'S EGG 

I'll make Him a little chocolate birthday-cake of his own, with his name 
on it in white sugar. He'll like that." 

So the next day Mrs. Chinks made Sneaky's birthday-cake, and she 
used the twiddley-egg in it. She didn't know it was a twiddley-egg, of 
course. She wrote Sneaky's name on the cake in white sugar and it looked 
fine. Then she sent it to Sneaky with her love. 

Sneaky loved chocolate cakes. When he saw the nice one that his 
aunt, Mrs. Chinks, had sent him, he was simply delighted. " I shall eat 
it all up myself," he said. " I shan't waste it on any one else at all." 

Well, he did eat it all himself and, as soon as he had eaten it the 
twiddley-egg that had gone to make the cake began to work inside him. 
And it turned his face bright green. 

My goodness me, what a shock Sneaky got when he saw himself in 
the glass! He stared and he stared and he shouted in rage: 

" There was a twiddley-egg in that cake ! There was, there was ! Oh, 
I'll give my aunt such a talking-to for using a twkldley-egg in her cake! 
Look what it's done to my face! It's as green as a cucumber." 

Sneaky rushed off to Mrs. Chinks in a fine temper. How she stared 
when she saw his face! It looked really dreadful. 

"You used a twiddley-egg in the birthday-cake you sent me! " 
shouted Sneaky. " You wicked woman! " 

" I didn't know it was a twiddley-egg, Sneaky," said Mrs. Chinks. 
" The brown mouse that keeps house for Little-toes the pixie, gave me 
the egg." 

" I'll tell Little-toes a few things! " roared Sneaky in a rage. " You 
come along and hear what I say to her! " 

He dragged Mrs. Chinks to Little-toes' house and began to shout 
at the pixie through the window. Little-toes was surprised. 

" I didn't know it was a twiddley-egg," she said. " It was given to 
me by kind old Mister Snooks." 

So Sneaky rushed off to old Mister Snooks, still dragging his poor 
aunt with him. Mister Snooks was amazed to see Sneaky's angry green 
face at his door when he opened it. 

" I didn't know that egg was a twiddley-egg when I sent it in to 
Little-toes," he said. " How dreadful you look, Sneaky! ' 

"Where did you get that twiddley-egg from? " shouted Sneaky. 

286 



THE TWIDDLEY-HEN'S EGG 

" Well, Dame Slap gave it to me most kindly," said Mister Snooks. 
" But she's such a dear old lady, I'm sure she wouldn't give me a twiddley- 
egg if she knew it was one." 

" Dame Slap's a horrid creature," said Sneaky. " She's slapped me 
many a time." 

" Then I've no doubt you deserved it," said Mister Snooks, who 
couldn't bear Sneaky. " I'll come straight along with you now and ask 
Dame Slap about it." 

So Mrs. Chinks, Sneaky, and Mister Snooks went to see Dame Slap. 
How the old woman shrieked when she opened her door and saw Sneaky's 
green face! 

" Oh, you've eaten a twiddley-egg ! " she cried. " How silly of you ! 
But I know how to get rid of the greenness, so don't worry." 

" It was you that gave the twiddley-egg to Mister Snooks," said 
Sneaky fiercely. " And he gave it to Little-toes and she gave it to my 
aunt, Mrs. Chinks and she put it into a birthday-cake she was making 
for me and I ate it all up. How dare you give Mister Snooks a twiddley- 

egg! " 

" I didn't know it was a twiddley-egg," said Dame Slap. " It had 
the green star rubbed off I wonder why! ' 

" Where did you get the egg, Dame Slap? " asked Mrs. Chinks 
suddenly. 

" Why Sneaky gave it to me himself! " said Dame Slap, remem- 
bering. " Oh, Sneaky ! How funny ! You gave me the very egg that has 
turned your own face green. Where did you get it from? ' 

Then Sneaky went red all over his green face and the others guessed 
at once what he had been up to. 

" You found the egg, Sneaky and you rubbed the green star off it 
and you gave it to Dame Slap to pay her out for slapping you last week ! ' 
cried Mrs. Chinks. " Yes and it's come back to you in a cake and 
your face has gone green. Ha, ha! It serves you right." 

" Please, Dame Slap, tell me how to get the green out of my face," 
said Sneaky in a small voice. 

" Not I ! " said Dame Slap. " You can keep that green face for ever. 
And every time you look in the glass it will remind you not to be mean 
and deceitful. Here's something to help you home, though." 

287 



THE TWIDDLEY-HEN'S EGG 




" I didn't know it was a Twiddley-hen's egg." 

And Dame Slap lifted up her hand and gave Sneaky such a hard slap 
that he shot half-way down the garden path. How the others laughed! 
You should have heard them. 

As for Sneaky, his face is still green. He really does look funny.
